or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   ","negative":""}

leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits

not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   ","negative":""}
{"id":20,"title":"great digital camera after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine  i decided to head here  to amazon  to read through the online reviews  the

replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality

regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings

shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little

 i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record

like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile

looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color

of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for   ","negative":""}
{"id":23,"title":"awesome prosumer camera when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700  olympus c5050  nikon cp5000  and the canon g3  yes  all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power  not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs  i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well  her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use  the nikon s are great cameras   they have great optics  cp5700 has great optical zoom  and features  not to mention take great pictures   the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer  the lcd screen is a little too small  cp5000 does not take photos in raw format  olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body   takes sharp 5mp photo s  has great features and relatively easy to use   i did nt care much for the tilting lcd screen  it seemed very limited and not very usefull  photos had some artifacts and noise  my fiance just did nt like the way it felt in her hands  we also looked at the fuji fps602  nice camera but does nt take as sharp as pictures i

very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll

pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the

focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   ","negative":""}
{"id":24,"title":"upgraded from g2 and not looking back camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first

{"id":25,"title":"the catch unresponsiveness2the catch with the canon g3 camera   and perhaps all of digital cameras  is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots  prior to the purchase  none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture  no one told me  but i wanted to tell you  this is not the same thing as a film camera  and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs  they have nt got all the bugs worked out just yet  most of the time  my g3 is a wellbehaved camera  but once in a while  i run up against it s major flaw  delay1uit sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button  i am not talking milliseconds  picture this  your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board  so you compose the shot and wait for your moment  when it arrives  you press the shutter release  splash  the moment passes  and then your new g3 camera takes the shot  perhaps there is a way around this delay  some feature i could turn on or off  or some attachment i could get  yes  i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay  yes  i have redeye off  and yes  i ve tried adding a flash  but after trying many adjustments  the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any filmbased camera  i own another canon  an eos  35mm film  camera  it focuses in a snap  dim or bright  it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out  after the tae kwon do kick broke the board  delay2ucanon s g3 does it consistently  focus2 shoot2it feels slow to focus  and unbearably slow to shoot  i challenge anyone  who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon  to say it is fast and responsive  and so i must ask  what are cameras for  what task do they perform  cameras capture moments  they stop time  because once the moment is gone  it is not coming back  the dive  the kick  the blowoutthecandles moments are  to me  the reason for cameras  a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want  while these digital cameras  my friends now inform me  all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture  not all the time  but often enough to be a real problem  like i said  when the moment is gone  it is gone  so buy the g3  buy it for fun  for lack of processing  because you want to use iphoto  or whatever  but do not assume  as i did  that the g3 has the same ability as  your current film camera  to stop the moment you choose  from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos  all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to  g32unfortunately  this digital momentcapturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work

with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode

series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments

{"id":27,"title":"the best 4mp out there 4mp camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact

press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a

manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where

can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a

lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   ","negative":""}
{"id":28,"title":"love it more and more i used a canon powershot s20 for about 25 years and loved it  there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world  losing a few that i really regretted  i finally decided to upgrade  and started my research  canon was an obvious choice  but i did not want to limit my decision  so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives  i researched  held  tested  and observed 3 different brands  needless to say  the canon won  hands down  this camera performs like i can not believe  performance","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop

you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that

are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that

digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   ","negative":""}
{"id":29,"title":"the last digital camera i ll buy i ve been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v  finally decided that now was the time  after a lot of research  i decided on the g3  camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7

digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews

{"id":30,"title":"boxy  no  gorgeous you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions  i was perfectly happy with my g2  so why did i trade up to the g3  camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely

pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   ","negative":""}
{"id":32,"title":"best of the best camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent

wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work

the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced

 i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot

like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details

stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   ","negative":""}
{"id":33,"title":"you ll take more pics i do nt write many reviews but i m compelled to do so with this camera  picture","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   ","negative":""}
{"id":34,"title":"excellent camera i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras  and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera  you can always spend more money to get a better one  camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice  design  feature use ubattery it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing  display also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage  excellent idea  compactflash2one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough  however  it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen   ","negative":""}
{"id":35,"title":"cannon camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice  design  feature use ubattery it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing  display also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage  excellent idea  compactflash2one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough  however  it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen   i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything  camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera   ","negative":""}
{"id":36,"title":"powerful product bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations  use","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice  design  feature use ubattery it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing  display also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage  excellent idea  compactflash2one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough  however  it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen   i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything  camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera   udesign uin general it is easy to use and well laid out  for  cool factor  buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does nt have any wow factor  use control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly  feature the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semipro  pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography  auto mode in the hands of someone who does nt  it will yield good results on idiot program  auto mode  my wife  who has never used a camera before  picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do nt like what you have created you just delete and try again  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses  this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 s large mobile screen helps with this  negative points  memory card2the included memory card is too small  go out and get a 256meg card  it s worth the expense  made2it is made of plastic  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped  picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience  this is by no means unique to this model  i m sure  lens1the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot  this is not a handbag camera  size1uwhile light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets  lever1the function lever  the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash1flash  as with all builtin flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful  and expensive  canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap2the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to  if you can afford this camera  you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere  a very minor quibble  good points  camera the functionality on this camera is mindblowing  option1 control canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out  learning learning how to use it will not take very long  image quality the image quality is excellent  messing around with images in photoshop  a supplied software package  and printing them on a good printer  yielded excellent results  unless you are making posters  a g3 is more than good enough  function range of functions  as indicated above  it has something for everyone  point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used  a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film  i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there s nothing like picking one up and playing with it first   ","negative":""}
{"id":37,"title":"best camera i ve used camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice  design  feature use ubattery it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing  display also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage  excellent idea  compactflash2one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough  however  it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen   i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything  camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera   udesign uin general it is easy to use and well laid out  for  cool factor  buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does nt have any wow factor  use control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly  feature the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semipro  pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography  auto mode in the hands of someone who does nt  it will yield good results on idiot program  auto mode  my wife  who has never used a camera before  picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do nt like what you have created you just delete and try again  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses  this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 s large mobile screen helps with this  negative points  memory card2the included memory card is too small  go out and get a 256meg card  it s worth the expense  made2it is made of plastic  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped  picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience  this is by no means unique to this model  i m sure  lens1the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot  this is not a handbag camera  size1uwhile light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets  lever1the function lever  the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash1flash  as with all builtin flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful  and expensive  canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap2the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to  if you can afford this camera  you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere  a very minor quibble  good points  camera the functionality on this camera is mindblowing  option1 control canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out  learning learning how to use it will not take very long  image quality the image quality is excellent  messing around with images in photoshop  a supplied software package  and printing them on a good printer  yielded excellent results  unless you are making posters  a g3 is more than good enough  function range of functions  as indicated above  it has something for everyone  point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used  a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film  i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there s nothing like picking one up and playing with it first   this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used  it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box  macro  auto mode the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot   ","negative":""}
{"id":38,"title":"this camera is closest to perfect than any otherdigicam camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice  design  feature use ubattery it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing  display also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage  excellent idea  compactflash2one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough  however  it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen   i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything  camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera   udesign uin general it is easy to use and well laid out  for  cool factor  buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does nt have any wow factor  use control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly  feature the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semipro  pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography  auto mode in the hands of someone who does nt  it will yield good results on idiot program  auto mode  my wife  who has never used a camera before  picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do nt like what you have created you just delete and try again  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses  this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 s large mobile screen helps with this  negative points  memory card2the included memory card is too small  go out and get a 256meg card  it s worth the expense  made2it is made of plastic  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped  picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience  this is by no means unique to this model  i m sure  lens1the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot  this is not a handbag camera  size1uwhile light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets  lever1the function lever  the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash1flash  as with all builtin flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful  and expensive  canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap2the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to  if you can afford this camera  you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere  a very minor quibble  good points  camera the functionality on this camera is mindblowing  option1 control canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out  learning learning how to use it will not take very long  image quality the image quality is excellent  messing around with images in photoshop  a supplied software package  and printing them on a good printer  yielded excellent results  unless you are making posters  a g3 is more than good enough  function range of functions  as indicated above  it has something for everyone  point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used  a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film  i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there s nothing like picking one up and playing with it first   this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used  it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box  macro  auto mode the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot   this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 45 megapixel  beats that sony f717  its archrival  4mp resolution i m glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology  i can t fit all that resolution  4mp  2272x 1704 resol   in my 19in flat monitor  1200x1024 resol   anyways  please go to read dpreviewcom and you ll get the complete story  my story is based on personal usage  distortion1uyes there is a corner lens barrel distortion  i do nt like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i m going to get  in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom  when you zoom the lens distortion goes away   canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon  that is what lmost exactly ot the picture  moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon  the distortion is not a flaw  as with taking digital pictures  i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost  this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand  i ve have nt heard about a diagnos or fix for this  shot in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great  picture learning curve the pictures are fabulous and their is a  short  learning curve to it  there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to  in terms of the important accessories  i got myself an the extra litium battery  based on my used  1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash  enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality  and a used  250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i ve taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash  the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions  camera and cf  bending  can lead to cf erros  or losing it  anyways  canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3  it s a winner  picture quality i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow  car  boat and wind  my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens  the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes  and i m getting the those  52 mm adapter and uv lens filter  at lensmateonlinecom  they got the best lens adapter for the g3better than canon s  that s what i did and hopes this helps   ","negative":""}
{"id":39,"title":"canon g3 review  response  recommendation camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice  design  feature use ubattery it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing  display also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage  excellent idea  compactflash2one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough  however  it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen   i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything  camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera   udesign uin general it is easy to use and well laid out  for  cool factor  buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does nt have any wow factor  use control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly  feature the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semipro  pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography  auto mode in the hands of someone who does nt  it will yield good results on idiot program  auto mode  my wife  who has never used a camera before  picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do nt like what you have created you just delete and try again  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses  this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 s large mobile screen helps with this  negative points  memory card2the included memory card is too small  go out and get a 256meg card  it s worth the expense  made2it is made of plastic  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped  picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience  this is by no means unique to this model  i m sure  lens1the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot  this is not a handbag camera  size1uwhile light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets  lever1the function lever  the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash1flash  as with all builtin flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful  and expensive  canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap2the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to  if you can afford this camera  you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere  a very minor quibble  good points  camera the functionality on this camera is mindblowing  option1 control canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out  learning learning how to use it will not take very long  image quality the image quality is excellent  messing around with images in photoshop  a supplied software package  and printing them on a good printer  yielded excellent results  unless you are making posters  a g3 is more than good enough  function range of functions  as indicated above  it has something for everyone  point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used  a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film  i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there s nothing like picking one up and playing with it first   this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used  it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box  macro  auto mode the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot   this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 45 megapixel  beats that sony f717  its archrival  4mp resolution i m glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology  i can t fit all that resolution  4mp  2272x 1704 resol   in my 19in flat monitor  1200x1024 resol   anyways  please go to read dpreviewcom and you ll get the complete story  my story is based on personal usage  distortion1uyes there is a corner lens barrel distortion  i do nt like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i m going to get  in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom  when you zoom the lens distortion goes away   canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon  that is what lmost exactly ot the picture  moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon  the distortion is not a flaw  as with taking digital pictures  i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost  this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand  i ve have nt heard about a diagnos or fix for this  shot in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great  picture learning curve the pictures are fabulous and their is a  short  learning curve to it  there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to  in terms of the important accessories  i got myself an the extra litium battery  based on my used  1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash  enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality  and a used  250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i ve taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash  the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions  camera and cf  bending  can lead to cf erros  or losing it  anyways  canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3  it s a winner  picture quality i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow  car  boat and wind  my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens  the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes  and i m getting the those  52 mm adapter and uv lens filter  at lensmateonlinecom  they got the best lens adapter for the g3better than canon s  that s what i did and hopes this helps   the camera s a work of art  science  that s understood  picture feel uit takes great pictures  operates quickly  and feels solid  viewfinder2to address two previous somewhat negative reviews   1  yes  the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder  however  the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder   2  there are  actually  several differences between the g2 and g3  such as differences in continuous shooting  the optical lens  the control layout  playback zoom  image processing  and so on   ","negative":""}
{"id":40,"title":"beware you see  i can t rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with  j and r camera   to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product

purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice  design  feature use ubattery it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing  display also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage  excellent idea  compactflash2one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough  however  it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen   i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything  camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera   udesign uin general it is easy to use and well laid out  for  cool factor  buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does nt have any wow factor  use control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly  feature the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semipro  pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography  auto mode in the hands of someone who does nt  it will yield good results on idiot program  auto mode  my wife  who has never used a camera before  picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do nt like what you have created you just delete and try again  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses  this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 s large mobile screen helps with this  negative points  memory card2the included memory card is too small  go out and get a 256meg card  it s worth the expense  made2it is made of plastic  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped  picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience  this is by no means unique to this model  i m sure  lens1the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot  this is not a handbag camera  size1uwhile light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets  lever1the function lever  the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash1flash  as with all builtin flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful  and expensive  canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap2the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to  if you can afford this camera  you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere  a very minor quibble  good points  camera the functionality on this camera is mindblowing  option1 control canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out  learning learning how to use it will not take very long  image quality the image quality is excellent  messing around with images in photoshop  a supplied software package  and printing them on a good printer  yielded excellent results  unless you are making posters  a g3 is more than good enough  function range of functions  as indicated above  it has something for everyone  point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used  a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film  i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there s nothing like picking one up and playing with it first   this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used  it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box  macro  auto mode the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot   this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 45 megapixel  beats that sony f717  its archrival  4mp resolution i m glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology  i can t fit all that resolution  4mp  2272x 1704 resol   in my 19in flat monitor  1200x1024 resol   anyways  please go to read dpreviewcom and you ll get the complete story  my story is based on personal usage  distortion1uyes there is a corner lens barrel distortion  i do nt like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i m going to get  in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom  when you zoom the lens distortion goes away   canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon  that is what lmost exactly ot the picture  moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon  the distortion is not a flaw  as with taking digital pictures  i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost  this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand  i ve have nt heard about a diagnos or fix for this  shot in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great  picture learning curve the pictures are fabulous and their is a  short  learning curve to it  there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to  in terms of the important accessories  i got myself an the extra litium battery  based on my used  1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash  enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality  and a used  250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i ve taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash  the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions  camera and cf  bending  can lead to cf erros  or losing it  anyways  canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3  it s a winner  picture quality i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow  car  boat and wind  my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens  the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes  and i m getting the those  52 mm adapter and uv lens filter  at lensmateonlinecom  they got the best lens adapter for the g3better than canon s  that s what i did and hopes this helps   the camera s a work of art  science  that s understood  picture feel uit takes great pictures  operates quickly  and feels solid  viewfinder2to address two previous somewhat negative reviews   1  yes  the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder  however  the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder   2  there are  actually  several differences between the g2 and g3  such as differences in continuous shooting  the optical lens  the control layout  playback zoom  image processing  and so on   ","negative":""}
{"id":41,"title":"major design flaw design3this camera has a major design flaw  viewfinder2when you look through the viewfinder  not the lcd  the bottom left corner of the picture  about 15   is blocked by the lens  i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera  after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder  they finally admitted  it was a design flaw in the camera  camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice  design  feature use ubattery it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing  display also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage  excellent idea  compactflash2one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough  however  it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen   i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything  camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera   udesign uin general it is easy to use and well laid out  for  cool factor  buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does nt have any wow factor  use control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly  feature the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semipro  pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography  auto mode in the hands of someone who does nt  it will yield good results on idiot program  auto mode  my wife  who has never used a camera before  picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do nt like what you have created you just delete and try again  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses  this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 s large mobile screen helps with this  negative points  memory card2the included memory card is too small  go out and get a 256meg card  it s worth the expense  made2it is made of plastic  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped  picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience  this is by no means unique to this model  i m sure  lens1the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot  this is not a handbag camera  size1uwhile light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets  lever1the function lever  the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash1flash  as with all builtin flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful  and expensive  canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap2the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to  if you can afford this camera  you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere  a very minor quibble  good points  camera the functionality on this camera is mindblowing  option1 control canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out  learning learning how to use it will not take very long  image quality the image quality is excellent  messing around with images in photoshop  a supplied software package  and printing them on a good printer  yielded excellent results  unless you are making posters  a g3 is more than good enough  function range of functions  as indicated above  it has something for everyone  point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used  a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film  i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there s nothing like picking one up and playing with it first   this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used  it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box  macro  auto mode the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot   this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 45 megapixel  beats that sony f717  its archrival  4mp resolution i m glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology  i can t fit all that resolution  4mp  2272x 1704 resol   in my 19in flat monitor  1200x1024 resol   anyways  please go to read dpreviewcom and you ll get the complete story  my story is based on personal usage  distortion1uyes there is a corner lens barrel distortion  i do nt like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i m going to get  in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom  when you zoom the lens distortion goes away   canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon  that is what lmost exactly ot the picture  moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon  the distortion is not a flaw  as with taking digital pictures  i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost  this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand  i ve have nt heard about a diagnos or fix for this  shot in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great  picture learning curve the pictures are fabulous and their is a  short  learning curve to it  there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to  in terms of the important accessories  i got myself an the extra litium battery  based on my used  1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash  enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality  and a used  250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i ve taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash  the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions  camera and cf  bending  can lead to cf erros  or losing it  anyways  canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3  it s a winner  picture quality i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow  car  boat and wind  my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens  the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes  and i m getting the those  52 mm adapter and uv lens filter  at lensmateonlinecom  they got the best lens adapter for the g3better than canon s  that s what i did and hopes this helps   the camera s a work of art  science  that s understood  picture feel uit takes great pictures  operates quickly  and feels solid  viewfinder2to address two previous somewhat negative reviews   1  yes  the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder  however  the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder   2  there are  actually  several differences between the g2 and g3  such as differences in continuous shooting  the optical lens  the control layout  playback zoom  image processing  and so on   everything else about the camera is great  camera if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder  i highly recommend the camera  however for me  i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much  i m sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected

{"id":42,"title":"i love it more the longer i own it i ve been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year  and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom  more adjustability  a hot shoe for an external flash  and a remote control  i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3  and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics  much more comfortable to hold and use  and the price  i ve had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far  camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice  design  feature use ubattery it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing  display also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage  excellent idea  compactflash2one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough  however  it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen   i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything  camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera   udesign uin general it is easy to use and well laid out  for  cool factor  buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does nt have any wow factor  use control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly  feature the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semipro  pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography  auto mode in the hands of someone who does nt  it will yield good results on idiot program  auto mode  my wife  who has never used a camera before  picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do nt like what you have created you just delete and try again  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses  this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 s large mobile screen helps with this  negative points  memory card2the included memory card is too small  go out and get a 256meg card  it s worth the expense  made2it is made of plastic  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped  picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience  this is by no means unique to this model  i m sure  lens1the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot  this is not a handbag camera  size1uwhile light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets  lever1the function lever  the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash1flash  as with all builtin flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful  and expensive  canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap2the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to  if you can afford this camera  you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere  a very minor quibble  good points  camera the functionality on this camera is mindblowing  option1 control canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out  learning learning how to use it will not take very long  image quality the image quality is excellent  messing around with images in photoshop  a supplied software package  and printing them on a good printer  yielded excellent results  unless you are making posters  a g3 is more than good enough  function range of functions  as indicated above  it has something for everyone  point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used  a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film  i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there s nothing like picking one up and playing with it first   this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used  it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box  macro  auto mode the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot   this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 45 megapixel  beats that sony f717  its archrival  4mp resolution i m glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology  i can t fit all that resolution  4mp  2272x 1704 resol   in my 19in flat monitor  1200x1024 resol   anyways  please go to read dpreviewcom and you ll get the complete story  my story is based on personal usage  distortion1uyes there is a corner lens barrel distortion  i do nt like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i m going to get  in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom  when you zoom the lens distortion goes away   canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon  that is what lmost exactly ot the picture  moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon  the distortion is not a flaw  as with taking digital pictures  i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost  this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand  i ve have nt heard about a diagnos or fix for this  shot in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great  picture learning curve the pictures are fabulous and their is a  short  learning curve to it  there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to  in terms of the important accessories  i got myself an the extra litium battery  based on my used  1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash  enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality  and a used  250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i ve taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash  the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions  camera and cf  bending  can lead to cf erros  or losing it  anyways  canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3  it s a winner  picture quality i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow  car  boat and wind  my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens  the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes  and i m getting the those  52 mm adapter and uv lens filter  at lensmateonlinecom  they got the best lens adapter for the g3better than canon s  that s what i did and hopes this helps   the camera s a work of art  science  that s understood  picture feel uit takes great pictures  operates quickly  and feels solid  viewfinder2to address two previous somewhat negative reviews   1  yes  the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder  however  the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder   2  there are  actually  several differences between the g2 and g3  such as differences in continuous shooting  the optical lens  the control layout  playback zoom  image processing  and so on   everything else about the camera is great  camera if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder  i highly recommend the camera  however for me  i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much  i m sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected   uand so far  i ve been very pleased  there s a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330  especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures  lens optical zoom the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light  and the 4times optical zooms gets you just that much closer  lcd the moveable lcd screen is great  you can take pictures with the camera held above your head  way down  or beside you with no problem  allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself  remote the tiny  postagestamp sized  remote unit is wonderful  not only does it trigger the shutter  it can also be used to zoom and review pictures  i also purchased a good sturdy tripod  the combination of the new camera  tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor  naturallight portraits i never would have attempted before  hot shoe flash the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit  i chose the canon speedlite 420  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs  the builtin flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos  redeye  and annoying shadows  a good addon flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing  almostnatural lighting  battery i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330  but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse  i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter s birthday party without switching out to my backup battery  battery charging system the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras  the battery needs to be charged while in the camera  but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery  manual i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options  shutter priority  aperature priority  light metering adjustments  etc  but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear  you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting  or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do  negatives  highlight1i ve been bothered by blownout highlights on the s330  and the g3 seems to do only slightly better   i m starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level   nooff button2the onoff button feels somewhat flimsy  and has an awkward  tiny little lockout button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera  body2and the body  construction in general has quite a bit of plastic  a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330  i bought a 512 mb card  which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution  download i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly  but there s no difference in working with the files  i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images  i can imagine that they d fill up my ibook s internal memory pretty quickly  at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe s photoshop elments 20 software  and can t praise it highly enough  if you re investing in a camera at this level  buy this software  and as i said in my review of the s330  all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers  the bottom line  if you re serious about your digital photography  or been bitten with the bug after using a digital pointandshoot  this may be just the camera for you  but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time  you ll see the difference in your photos immediately  added 224  camera i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it  i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom whitebalance setting  it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures  especially in mixedlight settings  if you do nt have a gray card  you can use a plain white piece of paper  i also discovered the exposurebracket setting  which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter  the first at the cameradetermined exposure  then one lighter and one darker  especially useful with portraits and difficulttometer situations  i did buy the telephoto lens  and the required extension   very easy to use  i ll probably also get the wideangle now  too  camera use photo very comfortable camera  easy to use  and the best digital photos you re going to get at this price   ","negative":""}
{"id":43,"title":"best nonslr digital camera under 5 megapixels g3","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice  design  feature use ubattery it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing  display also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage  excellent idea  compactflash2one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough  however  it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen   i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything  camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera   udesign uin general it is easy to use and well laid out  for  cool factor  buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does nt have any wow factor  use control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly  feature the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semipro  pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography  auto mode in the hands of someone who does nt  it will yield good results on idiot program  auto mode  my wife  who has never used a camera before  picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do nt like what you have created you just delete and try again  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses  this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 s large mobile screen helps with this  negative points  memory card2the included memory card is too small  go out and get a 256meg card  it s worth the expense  made2it is made of plastic  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped  picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience  this is by no means unique to this model  i m sure  lens1the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot  this is not a handbag camera  size1uwhile light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets  lever1the function lever  the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash1flash  as with all builtin flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful  and expensive  canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap2the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to  if you can afford this camera  you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere  a very minor quibble  good points  camera the functionality on this camera is mindblowing  option1 control canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out  learning learning how to use it will not take very long  image quality the image quality is excellent  messing around with images in photoshop  a supplied software package  and printing them on a good printer  yielded excellent results  unless you are making posters  a g3 is more than good enough  function range of functions  as indicated above  it has something for everyone  point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used  a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film  i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there s nothing like picking one up and playing with it first   this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used  it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box  macro  auto mode the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot   this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 45 megapixel  beats that sony f717  its archrival  4mp resolution i m glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology  i can t fit all that resolution  4mp  2272x 1704 resol   in my 19in flat monitor  1200x1024 resol   anyways  please go to read dpreviewcom and you ll get the complete story  my story is based on personal usage  distortion1uyes there is a corner lens barrel distortion  i do nt like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i m going to get  in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom  when you zoom the lens distortion goes away   canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon  that is what lmost exactly ot the picture  moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon  the distortion is not a flaw  as with taking digital pictures  i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost  this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand  i ve have nt heard about a diagnos or fix for this  shot in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great  picture learning curve the pictures are fabulous and their is a  short  learning curve to it  there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to  in terms of the important accessories  i got myself an the extra litium battery  based on my used  1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash  enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality  and a used  250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i ve taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash  the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions  camera and cf  bending  can lead to cf erros  or losing it  anyways  canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3  it s a winner  picture quality i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow  car  boat and wind  my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens  the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes  and i m getting the those  52 mm adapter and uv lens filter  at lensmateonlinecom  they got the best lens adapter for the g3better than canon s  that s what i did and hopes this helps   the camera s a work of art  science  that s understood  picture feel uit takes great pictures  operates quickly  and feels solid  viewfinder2to address two previous somewhat negative reviews   1  yes  the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder  however  the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder   2  there are  actually  several differences between the g2 and g3  such as differences in continuous shooting  the optical lens  the control layout  playback zoom  image processing  and so on   everything else about the camera is great  camera if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder  i highly recommend the camera  however for me  i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much  i m sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected   uand so far  i ve been very pleased  there s a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330  especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures  lens optical zoom the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light  and the 4times optical zooms gets you just that much closer  lcd the moveable lcd screen is great  you can take pictures with the camera held above your head  way down  or beside you with no problem  allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself  remote the tiny  postagestamp sized  remote unit is wonderful  not only does it trigger the shutter  it can also be used to zoom and review pictures  i also purchased a good sturdy tripod  the combination of the new camera  tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor  naturallight portraits i never would have attempted before  hot shoe flash the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit  i chose the canon speedlite 420  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs  the builtin flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos  redeye  and annoying shadows  a good addon flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing  almostnatural lighting  battery i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330  but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse  i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter s birthday party without switching out to my backup battery  battery charging system the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras  the battery needs to be charged while in the camera  but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery  manual i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options  shutter priority  aperature priority  light metering adjustments  etc  but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear  you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting  or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do  negatives  highlight1i ve been bothered by blownout highlights on the s330  and the g3 seems to do only slightly better   i m starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level   nooff button2the onoff button feels somewhat flimsy  and has an awkward  tiny little lockout button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera  body2and the body  construction in general has quite a bit of plastic  a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330  i bought a 512 mb card  which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution  download i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly  but there s no difference in working with the files  i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images  i can imagine that they d fill up my ibook s internal memory pretty quickly  at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe s photoshop elments 20 software  and can t praise it highly enough  if you re investing in a camera at this level  buy this software  and as i said in my review of the s330  all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers  the bottom line  if you re serious about your digital photography  or been bitten with the bug after using a digital pointandshoot  this may be just the camera for you  but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time  you ll see the difference in your photos immediately  added 224  camera i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it  i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom whitebalance setting  it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures  especially in mixedlight settings  if you do nt have a gray card  you can use a plain white piece of paper  i also discovered the exposurebracket setting  which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter  the first at the cameradetermined exposure  then one lighter and one darker  especially useful with portraits and difficulttometer situations  i did buy the telephoto lens  and the required extension   very easy to use  i ll probably also get the wideangle now  too  camera use photo very comfortable camera  easy to use  and the best digital photos you re going to get at this price   i ve been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it s advertised  after doing a handson comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dscf 717  both of which lack the quality  feel  or features of the g3   i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality  resolution and coloration are superior   it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life  enthusiast features  external flash capabilities  available storage types  image formats  and more  this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features  it can be a pointandshoot camera  but if you do not intend to  get into  it s finer features  i d suggest a less enthusiast featured choice  camera allinall  i believe this is arguably the best nonslr digital camera on the market

{"id":44,"title":"the best so far the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it  and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance  picture quality and battery life   which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera  optic","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice  design  feature use ubattery it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing  display also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage  excellent idea  compactflash2one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough  however  it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen   i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything  camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera   udesign uin general it is easy to use and well laid out  for  cool factor  buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does nt have any wow factor  use control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly  feature the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semipro  pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography  auto mode in the hands of someone who does nt  it will yield good results on idiot program  auto mode  my wife  who has never used a camera before  picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do nt like what you have created you just delete and try again  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses  this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 s large mobile screen helps with this  negative points  memory card2the included memory card is too small  go out and get a 256meg card  it s worth the expense  made2it is made of plastic  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped  picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience  this is by no means unique to this model  i m sure  lens1the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot  this is not a handbag camera  size1uwhile light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets  lever1the function lever  the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash1flash  as with all builtin flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful  and expensive  canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap2the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to  if you can afford this camera  you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere  a very minor quibble  good points  camera the functionality on this camera is mindblowing  option1 control canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out  learning learning how to use it will not take very long  image quality the image quality is excellent  messing around with images in photoshop  a supplied software package  and printing them on a good printer  yielded excellent results  unless you are making posters  a g3 is more than good enough  function range of functions  as indicated above  it has something for everyone  point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used  a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film  i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there s nothing like picking one up and playing with it first   this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used  it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box  macro  auto mode the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot   this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 45 megapixel  beats that sony f717  its archrival  4mp resolution i m glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology  i can t fit all that resolution  4mp  2272x 1704 resol   in my 19in flat monitor  1200x1024 resol   anyways  please go to read dpreviewcom and you ll get the complete story  my story is based on personal usage  distortion1uyes there is a corner lens barrel distortion  i do nt like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i m going to get  in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom  when you zoom the lens distortion goes away   canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon  that is what lmost exactly ot the picture  moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon  the distortion is not a flaw  as with taking digital pictures  i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost  this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand  i ve have nt heard about a diagnos or fix for this  shot in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great  picture learning curve the pictures are fabulous and their is a  short  learning curve to it  there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to  in terms of the important accessories  i got myself an the extra litium battery  based on my used  1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash  enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality  and a used  250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i ve taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash  the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions  camera and cf  bending  can lead to cf erros  or losing it  anyways  canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3  it s a winner  picture quality i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow  car  boat and wind  my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens  the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes  and i m getting the those  52 mm adapter and uv lens filter  at lensmateonlinecom  they got the best lens adapter for the g3better than canon s  that s what i did and hopes this helps   the camera s a work of art  science  that s understood  picture feel uit takes great pictures  operates quickly  and feels solid  viewfinder2to address two previous somewhat negative reviews   1  yes  the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder  however  the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder   2  there are  actually  several differences between the g2 and g3  such as differences in continuous shooting  the optical lens  the control layout  playback zoom  image processing  and so on   everything else about the camera is great  camera if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder  i highly recommend the camera  however for me  i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much  i m sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected   uand so far  i ve been very pleased  there s a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330  especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures  lens optical zoom the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light  and the 4times optical zooms gets you just that much closer  lcd the moveable lcd screen is great  you can take pictures with the camera held above your head  way down  or beside you with no problem  allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself  remote the tiny  postagestamp sized  remote unit is wonderful  not only does it trigger the shutter  it can also be used to zoom and review pictures  i also purchased a good sturdy tripod  the combination of the new camera  tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor  naturallight portraits i never would have attempted before  hot shoe flash the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit  i chose the canon speedlite 420  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs  the builtin flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos  redeye  and annoying shadows  a good addon flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing  almostnatural lighting  battery i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330  but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse  i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter s birthday party without switching out to my backup battery  battery charging system the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras  the battery needs to be charged while in the camera  but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery  manual i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options  shutter priority  aperature priority  light metering adjustments  etc  but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear  you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting  or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do  negatives  highlight1i ve been bothered by blownout highlights on the s330  and the g3 seems to do only slightly better   i m starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level   nooff button2the onoff button feels somewhat flimsy  and has an awkward  tiny little lockout button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera  body2and the body  construction in general has quite a bit of plastic  a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330  i bought a 512 mb card  which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution  download i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly  but there s no difference in working with the files  i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images  i can imagine that they d fill up my ibook s internal memory pretty quickly  at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe s photoshop elments 20 software  and can t praise it highly enough  if you re investing in a camera at this level  buy this software  and as i said in my review of the s330  all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers  the bottom line  if you re serious about your digital photography  or been bitten with the bug after using a digital pointandshoot  this may be just the camera for you  but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time  you ll see the difference in your photos immediately  added 224  camera i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it  i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom whitebalance setting  it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures  especially in mixedlight settings  if you do nt have a gray card  you can use a plain white piece of paper  i also discovered the exposurebracket setting  which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter  the first at the cameradetermined exposure  then one lighter and one darker  especially useful with portraits and difficulttometer situations  i did buy the telephoto lens  and the required extension   very easy to use  i ll probably also get the wideangle now  too  camera use photo very comfortable camera  easy to use  and the best digital photos you re going to get at this price   i ve been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it s advertised  after doing a handson comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dscf 717  both of which lack the quality  feel  or features of the g3   i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality  resolution and coloration are superior   it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life  enthusiast features  external flash capabilities  available storage types  image formats  and more  this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features  it can be a pointandshoot camera  but if you do not intend to  get into  it s finer features  i d suggest a less enthusiast featured choice  camera allinall  i believe this is arguably the best nonslr digital camera on the market   canon s optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better  digital camera simply  the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point  the canon allows you to change lenses  and it accepts the ibm microdrive  type ii compact flash   so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage  for me on the fine resolution setting  not maximum but very close  this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card  battery life the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i ve seen  look2the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking  it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap  and it is a bit slow between shots  camera even with these shortcomings  i still think it is the best digital camera available under  1200   ","negative":""}
{"id":45,"title":"great camera but g2 will do the same for less camera","positive":"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase  use the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group  after i took their picture with their camera  they offered to take a picture of us  i just told them  press halfway  wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way  picture they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar   picture quality a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality  picture quality i m easily enlarging pictures to 8 12 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet  super fine   ensure you get a larger flash  128 or 256  some are selling with the larger flash  32mb will do in a pinch but you ll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras  camera  use  feature bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices  picture quality  use  option i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like  great job canon   this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is  i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy  i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera  and i must say  g3 worth every single cent i spent on it  picture just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance  use whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together   you can have different kind of lens if you want  flashes  etc as its 4mp  you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies  you can record 3 minutes of video   i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast  a good choice could be cf type ii  microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images  some things that i did nt like  but hey  nothing is perfect  dial1 main dial is not backlit  viewfinder2 lens visible in optical viewfinder   well thats only for oldschool diehard optical viewfinder fans  use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera poverall i m happy with my toy   in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera  speed picture quality function i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers  auto setting with the automatic settings  i really have nt taken a bad picture yet  and with the panoramic  stitch  mode  it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image  camera i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3  do nt walk  run and buy this camera if you have the budget  i guarantee you will not be disappointed   i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied  photo quality i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality  feature the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds  flaws  viewfinder1the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography   i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful  photo quality the photo quality is amazing and i know i m going to have fun with all the features  i ve figured out most of its features on my own already  because i have used digital cameras before  so i know things like symbols   i m one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i ve been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top  but that does nt stop me from loving this camera  darn diopter adjustment dial1the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment  for those of you who do nt know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight   i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review   auto setting 1  slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do nt want to bother with the settings  metering option excellent range of metering options as well  spot metering it s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen  4mp 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer  zoom 3  4x zoom is nice 4  the great thing about digital  in general  is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture  not two weeks later when you get the film developed  focus 5  its focusing system is also very flexible  focus you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus  negatives size2uweight2u1  quite bulky  it s about the same size as my minolta vectis s1 aps slr  and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic  unlike canon s elph line  design2u2  not very ergonomical  you ll find even for a pointandshoot lens  viewfinder24  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying    the camera has a wonderful set of features  lcd the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd  optical zoom digital zoom the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry  picture the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect  picture i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased  software the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use  lens cap1viewfinder1the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd   menu button the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use  camera it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price   recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available  control advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable  auto setting newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box  photo quality 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome  do nt get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype  unless you want to print murals  you do nt need it  use uthose used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use  anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference  zoom lense the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class  i expect the g3 will please me for years to come   i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period  picture  control  battery  software it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing  photo quality  auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode  absolutely breathtaking  i was considering the olympus camedia c5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out  the olympus is a bit clumsylooking and the userinterface not as friendly as the canon  but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life  no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3  i would recommend a larger compactflash card  at least 128 mb  i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon   this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print the prints are beautiful  and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality  i tried out some other brands in the stores  and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company  plus what you see in the lcd  no optical finder  is nt what you get  not even for color  the output was less than i expected  battery although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon   this is a great camera for you  control auto mode the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus  photo i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers  warning  i did read the manual  control but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options  it does nt do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can t access them quickly when you need them  feel weight this camera also has a great feel and weight to it  feel you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy  camera pthe more i work with it  the more i love it  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow  camera ui did nt think i would find this quality and ease of use for under  1500  i m thrilled with my purchase   this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it  i do not know a whole lot about photography  but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform  even as i grow in skill and knowledge  camera useriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want  picture  auto mode but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  four megapixel four megapixels is great  i know there are five mp cameras out there  but this thing does just fine for me  if you want  check out the canon website and they have some sample images  taken by this camera  for you to download  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera  this is probably not what you are looking for  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex  this is it  product uit is a very amazing product  camera pi highly recommend it   just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo takes excellent photos  night mode night mode is clear as day  use ui have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it  viewfinder1the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens  however  using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera overall it is the best camera on the market  i give it 10 stars   a  the picture quality  color and sharpness of focusing  are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging  how could one eat rice one grain at a time     lens cover2b  the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently fingerprinted the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage  i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever2the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you ll feel uneasy   i love this camera  i am still trying to figure out the may options it has  picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great  color picture white balance great colors  pictures and white balance  optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range  it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for   when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome  camera the camera was a marvel  getting the printer to help output them was another tale  overall i think that you need to consider what you want to do  for simple point and shoot photography  consider a cheaper digital  you do nt need the extra resolution or the cost  then again a one time use camera may do just as well  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality  this will be your camera  camera pit is versatile and seems to be one of the best  me  i am going with a leica minilux  the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen   sure  it is less versatile  but i am never disappointed with the output   i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images  lag time2flash2the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash  as of this writing  technology has not solved the focuslock lag time problem for pointandshoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr  at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 110 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available  depth what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8  once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject  a pet or a child  strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus  now what about the flash problem  flash2relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4  i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct4  for those who have this metz flash  or the 45cl3  and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c  in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and fstop yourself  flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon  you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow  then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored  the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself  this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounceflashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away  unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved  the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz  with the attendant shadows unfortunately   but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera  the 60 ct4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you  the results are shadowfree images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software2now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7  software2the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera  i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information  maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces  i didnt wait to experiment  instead  i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plugin  g3 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware  color without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image  g3 software2the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software2what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical  what the photoshop plugin gives you is reality  and then if you want fantasy  you can use photoshop to create it  image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits   pi ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision  camera this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k reeves  whoa  manual function picture quality manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding  i did a good month s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras  and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder1lcd camera not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp  if you do nt believe me on that  check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there  or save time and just do it  you wo nt regret it   the service from the supplier was exceptional  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos  recently  i attended a  flyball  competition  an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode manual mode the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macrofocussing option to shoot wonderful closeup photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder2about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler  but who cares  i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera   but canon never fails to amaze  some of the great gains over g2  raw format 1  the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more postprocessing flexibility  battery life 2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons  software 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing  looks sort of like picasa software  google it if you dont know  in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 s  but more intuitive  shape 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking  a big plus in my book  5  the 1200 sec  f56  nd filter for highly exposed  or very brightly lit  environments  light auto correction the light autocorrection is awesome  picture you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right  6  the g2 s  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed  the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes  there are six default settings  off  vivid  sepia  neutral  low sharpening  b  w  as well as a  custom effect  that allows you to control sharpening  contrast and saturation  7  a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera   looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have  er  canonized it a bit  white offset 8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets  in english  this means that even straight out of the box  you ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking  9  in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera  and thankfully g3 maintains this rep  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g3 overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view  there s really very little about g3 images to criticize  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon  both slrs  camera pthis is quite simply the best you can ask for    use  software 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up   a lot of research went into digital camera s before i made this purchase  and hands down  the g3 had everything i needed plus more  the other cameras were great and i m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations  but to each his  her own  i have no buyers remorse with this baby  and i never will  always remember  cameras do nt take great pictures  people do   the powershot g3 is a great camera  why  photo because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos  camera 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera  feature it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features  make sure you get a big compactflash card  it comes with a 32mb   the 512mb cards are pretty  inexpensive  here on amazoncom and can hold about 500 photos at a time   this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier  i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it  picture quality i love the quality of the pictures  picture quality pthey look fantastic  i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens  it s just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments   the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there  i ve tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens  but the pictures were too digital  picture with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots  control menu i love the eos based controls and easy menus  i do nt need to go into exhustive review of this camera  many before me have done that already  i agree with the positive reviews  but there are two things i do nt like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews  lens cap21  the included lens cap is very loose on the camera  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on  the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself  i m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap  i may damage the lens  very cheaply made  body22  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic  the g2 was better in this respect  casing2it had a heavier and more sturdy casing  despite these grieps  i still recommend the camera   pi bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features  so i generally used the auto mode  camera this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it  battery life another point of note  the battery life is incredible  i did not have a backup battery  and had no need for one  i did have ability to charge it every night  so do nt know how long it would have actually gone before dying  this camera will stay with me for years   am i ever glad that i decided on this camera  camera i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy  forget the fact that it ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer  i ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual  menu very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera  i charged it up the day i got it  took a bunch of pictures and i do nt think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged  battery the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging  i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 2030 pictures  optical zoom viewfinder the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom  viewfinder2one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all  as i said  this is the last digital camera i ll buy  and if you are in the market one  my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever  these things may get a lot better in the future  but from what i ve seen in the last few years  the technology for digital cameras is nt advancing at the pace of pc s  phones and hard drives  camera the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use  highly recommended  for more info on digital cameras  go to dpreviews   because this camera is beautiful  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish  very homely  look the g3 looks like a work of art  finish its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen  the little digital elphs were the bestdesigned  mostelegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them   pi am very pleased with it so far  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time  this seemed like a really good compromise  i compared it to the olympus c5050z  the sony dcsf 717 and the nikon 5700  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews  this one seemed like the best all round deal  it is not perfect though  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera  viewfinder2you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder  tiff format2 i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad  there is no tiff format  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw  to save a picture as raw  you have to have the display on  this seems like a waste of battery power  lag2it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter  trips   again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are   for those of you using a mac in os x there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop  i have not spent much time with the included software  so i dont know what to say about it other than it seems ok  camera i am quite happy with the camera  manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep  camera pyes  i recommend it over the competition   best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything  stitch picture this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon s website  i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this  for those of you who already bought this camera  i suggest you buy a hiti dyesub photo printer   first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic s for just a couple of keepers  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time  the technology is finally here folks  to make your photo life easier  a great new use for that underutilized computer  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use  poor quality pics  short battery life  slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home  but now she s forever asking for the digital camera  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want  let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones  which are not many   get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash  in short  i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots  i have nt used any of them since i got the g3  unless your a professional  now you will need only one camera  this one   however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice  design  feature use ubattery it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing  display also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage  excellent idea  compactflash2one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough  however  it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen   i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything  camera it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera   udesign uin general it is easy to use and well laid out  for  cool factor  buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does nt have any wow factor  use control it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly  feature the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semipro  pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography  auto mode in the hands of someone who does nt  it will yield good results on idiot program  auto mode  my wife  who has never used a camera before  picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do nt like what you have created you just delete and try again  the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses  this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 s large mobile screen helps with this  negative points  memory card2the included memory card is too small  go out and get a 256meg card  it s worth the expense  made2it is made of plastic  for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped  picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience  this is by no means unique to this model  i m sure  lens1the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot  this is not a handbag camera  size1uwhile light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets  lever1the function lever  the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash1flash  as with all builtin flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost  the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful  and expensive  canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap2the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to  if you can afford this camera  you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere  a very minor quibble  good points  camera the functionality on this camera is mindblowing  option1 control canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out  learning learning how to use it will not take very long  image quality the image quality is excellent  messing around with images in photoshop  a supplied software package  and printing them on a good printer  yielded excellent results  unless you are making posters  a g3 is more than good enough  function range of functions  as indicated above  it has something for everyone  point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography  please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used  a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film  i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there s nothing like picking one up and playing with it first   this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used  it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box  macro  auto mode the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot   this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 45 megapixel  beats that sony f717  its archrival  4mp resolution i m glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology  i can t fit all that resolution  4mp  2272x 1704 resol   in my 19in flat monitor  1200x1024 resol   anyways  please go to read dpreviewcom and you ll get the complete story  my story is based on personal usage  distortion1uyes there is a corner lens barrel distortion  i do nt like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i m going to get  in the viewfinder when you do nt zoom  when you zoom the lens distortion goes away   canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon  that is what lmost exactly ot the picture  moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon  the distortion is not a flaw  as with taking digital pictures  i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost  this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand  i ve have nt heard about a diagnos or fix for this  shot in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great  picture learning curve the pictures are fabulous and their is a  short  learning curve to it  there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to  in terms of the important accessories  i got myself an the extra litium battery  based on my used  1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots  i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash  enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality  and a used  250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i ve taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash  the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions  camera and cf  bending  can lead to cf erros  or losing it  anyways  canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3  it s a winner  picture quality i ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow  car  boat and wind  my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens  the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes  and i m getting the those  52 mm adapter and uv lens filter  at lensmateonlinecom  they got the best lens adapter for the g3better than canon s  that s what i did and hopes this helps   the camera s a work of art  science  that s understood  picture feel uit takes great pictures  operates quickly  and feels solid  viewfinder2to address two previous somewhat negative reviews   1  yes  the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder  however  the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder   2  there are  actually  several differences between the g2 and g3  such as differences in continuous shooting  the optical lens  the control layout  playback zoom  image processing  and so on   everything else about the camera is great  camera if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder  i highly recommend the camera  however for me  i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much  i m sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected   uand so far  i ve been very pleased  there s a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330  especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures  lens optical zoom the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light  and the 4times optical zooms gets you just that much closer  lcd the moveable lcd screen is great  you can take pictures with the camera held above your head  way down  or beside you with no problem  allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself  remote the tiny  postagestamp sized  remote unit is wonderful  not only does it trigger the shutter  it can also be used to zoom and review pictures  i also purchased a good sturdy tripod  the combination of the new camera  tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor  naturallight portraits i never would have attempted before  hot shoe flash the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit  i chose the canon speedlite 420  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs  the builtin flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos  redeye  and annoying shadows  a good addon flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing  almostnatural lighting  battery i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330  but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse  i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter s birthday party without switching out to my backup battery  battery charging system the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras  the battery needs to be charged while in the camera  but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery  manual i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options  shutter priority  aperature priority  light metering adjustments  etc  but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear  you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting  or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do  negatives  highlight1i ve been bothered by blownout highlights on the s330  and the g3 seems to do only slightly better   i m starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level   nooff button2the onoff button feels somewhat flimsy  and has an awkward  tiny little lockout button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera  body2and the body  construction in general has quite a bit of plastic  a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330  i bought a 512 mb card  which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution  download i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly  but there s no difference in working with the files  i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images  i can imagine that they d fill up my ibook s internal memory pretty quickly  at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe s photoshop elments 20 software  and can t praise it highly enough  if you re investing in a camera at this level  buy this software  and as i said in my review of the s330  all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers  the bottom line  if you re serious about your digital photography  or been bitten with the bug after using a digital pointandshoot  this may be just the camera for you  but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time  you ll see the difference in your photos immediately  added 224  camera i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it  i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom whitebalance setting  it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures  especially in mixedlight settings  if you do nt have a gray card  you can use a plain white piece of paper  i also discovered the exposurebracket setting  which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter  the first at the cameradetermined exposure  then one lighter and one darker  especially useful with portraits and difficulttometer situations  i did buy the telephoto lens  and the required extension   very easy to use  i ll probably also get the wideangle now  too  camera use photo very comfortable camera  easy to use  and the best digital photos you re going to get at this price   i ve been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it s advertised  after doing a handson comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dscf 717  both of which lack the quality  feel  or features of the g3   i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality  resolution and coloration are superior   it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life  enthusiast features  external flash capabilities  available storage types  image formats  and more  this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features  it can be a pointandshoot camera  but if you do not intend to  get into  it s finer features  i d suggest a less enthusiast featured choice  camera allinall  i believe this is arguably the best nonslr digital camera on the market   canon s optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better  digital camera simply  the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point  the canon allows you to change lenses  and it accepts the ibm microdrive  type ii compact flash   so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage  for me on the fine resolution setting  not maximum but very close  this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card  battery life the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i ve seen  look2the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking  it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap  and it is a bit slow between shots  camera even with these shortcomings  i still think it is the best digital camera available under  1200   definetely a great camera  quality lens proven canon built quality and lens  feel feels solid in hand  weight1camera rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros   ","negative":""}
