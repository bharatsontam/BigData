comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit  included  is fast and small  i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery  so it s good to go on a long vacation  camera i enthusiastically recommend this camera   p use u feature it s easy to use  and yet very feature rich  auto mode scene mode in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click  the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results  manual mode the manual mode is feature rich and i can t wait to get the hang of it  macro mode picture the macro mode is exceptional  the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject  battery life the battery life is very good  i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time  the first

modes  or fine tune the options  i you can change the iso level  shutter speed  etc camera this camera is ideal for people who want more power  but do nt want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera   with nikon  although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras  i ve had the following headaches  transfer21  pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable  i did everything i could  and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader  card reader is included  2  the speed is noticeably slower than canon  especially so with flashes on  3  with low battery  it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip  i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar  be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries    picture  closeup shooting but overall this is a good camera with a  really good  picture clarity  an exceptional closeup shooting capability  i would rate this is 45 stars picture quality  image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix   customer service2it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality  but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service   delay otherwise  it takes very good pictures  shutter delay is nt so bad either  still  had to send it back to nikon for repair   nikon 4300  i feel  is the best camera out there for the features and price  here were my requirements in a digital camera  1  i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6  or 5x7  prints and i wanted some really great 8x10  photos once in a while  2  i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was nt comfortable with that  i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily  3  i wanted a camera that had a lot of builtin settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although  i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings  4  and  of course  i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had nt used it much  depending on all the above requirements  i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models  nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes  medium compact size  price  brand name  good software that is included and previous reviews  i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since  picture the pictures are absolutely amazing  the camera captures the minutest of details  a few things that might make it even better  indoor picture11  pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay2u2  it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow  picture23  the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture  all the above  i think  are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints  try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems  whichever camera you buy  add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card  usb card reader  camera bag and the warranty  and finally  get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra  no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness

photographs now    manual mode  scene mode the possibilities with auto  manual  and the very helpful  scene  mode  which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait  landscape  beach  snow

a  digital   battery life the battery life is ok  but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on  i therefore bought a second battery as a backup  and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger  which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe  we ran never out of  juice   i highly recommend the accessory kit  which provides you with everything else you need  a nice camera bag  which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger  furher it contains a card reader  a flash card folder for up to 8 cards  a lense cleaning rag  and an ac adapter  which is very helpful when working in an  outlet environment   camera over all a fantastic very compact camera  which made us experience photography on a totally new level   after nearly 800 pictures

included  is fast and small  i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery  so it s good to go on a long vacation  camera i enthusiastically recommend this camera   p use u feature it s easy to use  and

feature rich and i can t wait to get the hang of it  macro mode picture the macro mode is exceptional  the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject  battery life the battery life is very good  i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time  the first time around  and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then  and have yet needed to recharge it  the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card  which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution  i intend to buy a bigger card soon    use i fell in love with this camera  it combines ease of use  with an immense amount of options and power  you can use the scene modes  or fine tune the options  i you can change the iso level  shutter

i ve had the following headaches  transfer21  pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable  i did everything i could  and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader  card reader is included  2  the speed is noticeably slower than canon  especially so with flashes on  3  with low battery  it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip  i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar  be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries    picture  closeup shooting but overall this is a good camera with a  really good  picture clarity  an exceptional closeup shooting capability  i would rate this is 45 stars picture quality  image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix   customer service2it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality  but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service   delay otherwise  it takes very good pictures  shutter delay is nt so bad either  still  had to send it back to nikon for repair   nikon 4300  i feel  is the best camera out there for the features and price  here were my requirements in a digital camera  1  i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6  or 5x7  prints and i wanted some really great 8x10  photos once in a while  2  i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was nt comfortable with that  i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily  3  i wanted a camera that had a lot of builtin settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although  i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings  4  and  of course  i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had nt used it much  depending on all the above requirements  i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models  nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes  medium compact size  price  brand name  good software that is included and previous reviews  i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since  picture the pictures are absolutely amazing  the camera captures the minutest of details  a few things that might make it even better  indoor picture11  pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay2u2  it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow  picture23  the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture  all the above  i think  are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints  try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems  whichever camera you buy  add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card  usb card reader  camera bag and the warranty  and finally  get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra  no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness  hope this review has helped you in making up your mind  i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience  i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now    manual mode  scene mode the possibilities with auto  manual  and the very helpful  scene  mode  which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait  landscape  beach  snow  sunset etc  are endless  movie mode the movie mode is also working

52 pictures on  normal  resolution  print i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers  and they both delivered great results  print even at the  normal

somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on  i therefore bought a second battery as a backup  and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger  which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe  we ran never out of  juice   i highly recommend the accessory kit  which provides you with everything else you need  a nice camera bag  which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger  furher it contains a card reader  a flash card folder for up to 8 cards  a lense cleaning rag  and an ac adapter  which is very helpful when working in an  outlet environment

average for these cameras  for more  you sacrifice weight and size  more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length  it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom  but you sacrifice

a camera store  manual the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain  auto focus scene mode the autofocus performs well  but i love having the 12 optional scene modes  they are dummyproof  and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera  rechargable battery comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit  included  is fast and small  i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery  so it s good to go on a long vacation  camera i enthusiastically recommend this camera   p use u feature it s easy to use  and yet very feature rich  auto mode scene mode in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click  the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results  manual mode the manual mode is feature rich and i can t wait to get the hang of it  macro mode picture the macro mode is exceptional  the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject  battery life the battery life is very good  i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time  the first time around  and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then  and have yet needed to recharge it  the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card  which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution  i intend to buy a bigger card soon    use i fell in love with this camera  it combines ease of use  with an immense amount of options and power  you can use the scene modes  or fine tune the options  i you can change the iso level  shutter speed  etc camera this camera is ideal for people who want more power  but do nt want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera   with nikon  although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras  i ve had the following headaches  transfer21  pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable  i did everything i could  and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader  card reader is included  2  the speed is noticeably slower than canon  especially so with flashes on  3  with low battery  it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip  i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar  be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries    picture  closeup shooting but overall this is a good camera with a  really good  picture clarity  an exceptional closeup shooting capability  i would rate this is 45 stars picture quality  image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix   customer service2it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality  but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service   delay otherwise  it takes very good pictures  shutter delay is nt so bad either  still  had to send it back to nikon for repair   nikon 4300  i feel  is the best camera out there for the features and price  here were my requirements in a digital camera  1  i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6  or 5x7  prints and i wanted some really great 8x10  photos once in a while  2  i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was nt comfortable with that  i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily  3  i wanted a camera that had a lot of builtin settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although  i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings  4  and  of course  i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had nt used it much  depending on all the above requirements  i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models  nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes  medium compact size  price  brand name  good software that is included and previous reviews  i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since  picture the pictures are absolutely amazing  the camera captures the minutest of details  a few things that might make it even better  indoor picture11  pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay2u2  it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow  picture23  the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture  all the above  i think  are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints  try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems  whichever camera you buy  add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card  usb card reader  camera bag and the warranty  and finally  get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra  no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness  hope this review has helped you in making up your mind  i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience  i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now    manual mode  scene mode the possibilities with auto  manual  and the very helpful  scene  mode  which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait  landscape  beach  snow  sunset etc  are endless  movie mode the movie mode is also working great  software the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem  battery charger  usb and video cable  a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on  normal  resolution  print i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers  and they both delivered great results  print even at the  normal  setting  a 8x10 print  shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels  you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a  digital   battery life the battery life is ok  but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on  i therefore bought a second battery as a backup  and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger  which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe  we ran never out of  juice   i highly recommend the accessory kit  which provides you with everything else you need  a nice camera bag  which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger  furher it contains a card reader  a flash card folder for up to 8 cards  a lense cleaning rag  and an ac adapter  which is very helpful when working in an  outlet environment   camera over all a fantastic very compact camera  which made us experience photography on a totally new level   after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures  digital zoom optical zoom the digital zoom takes as good of pictures  as the optical zoom does  picture2the inside pics  can be a bit challenging  but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like  that are not focused perfectly  or need lighting adjustments  make this camera very simple and effective  feature i love all of the features  and presets as well  sunset feature sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning  and the evening  software the software you get with this camera is perfect  touchup  redeye touchups  redeye  and so on are very easy to alter  and correct  i definately recommend a large memory card  i use a 128mb card  and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 10241280 res  with good resolution  very large pics take 8mb each  battery life battery life is good  although i recommend two rechargebles  or a alkaline backup  for those emergency pics you have to have  camera all and all  i am extremely pleased with this camera  making the step from film to digital has been a great move  i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know  camera great camera  great investment   uquality size the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful  easy to use  high quality  and compact in size  with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation  auto setting the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them  if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300  i would order another just like it   pit has many great features and very few bad ones  picture ease of use it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use  if you read the manual  if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual  lcd1the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too  download downloads are a snap and quick  control controls easy yo use and easy to get to  camera i m extremely glad i bought this camera   really happy with this little camera  size uit is nt big and offensive  though you would nt know it by looking at the pics it takes  got it for christmas  still learning a few of the settings  but i do nt take pictures every single day  picture print settings for just about everything  beautiful pics and beautiful prints  zoomed image i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy  but onfull size high to fine quality  the zoomed images are quite impressive  did buy a 256mb compact flash  it holds a lot of pics at any resolution  i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions  but does nt seem any of the buget cameras do  camera still  at least from my perspective  a great camera for the money  and i m a happy camper   this is a wonderful camera  my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months  in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer s remorse  4mp optical zoom 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience  cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera  3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price  picture one neat thing  i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms  no problem for the camera  rooms looked like they had ample lighting   this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much  software  online service the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95  of all photos taken by a beginner  100  perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos  i took the camera and just gave it to someone  no instructions  photo just point and shoot and the photos were great  just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos  memory card the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla  my pda becames a digital album  i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos  camera if you have to buy a camera on a buget this has got to be the one  go get it  before they are sold out   great camera  i have been using this for several months and got excellent results  simple friendly usage  in many scenes indoor  outdoor  snow  close up macro etc   feature this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has  use uit is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into  macro i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots  picture quality my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took  autofocus2one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low  i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life battery life is ok  i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it   great camera  and for the price you can t beat it  i ve been using it for about 3 months now  control i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly  quality the quality is superb  size the small size is perfect for my little hands  but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person   the 4300 is a very durable  compact package  and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust  it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade  we got a 256mb card  and have been hardpressed to fill it over a weekend  the only drawbacks that i have noticed  battery2it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long  especially if you use the flash a lot  so  it s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  autofocus assist light1it does not have an autofocus assist light which is nice for taking shots in lowlight situations it allows the camera to focus in low light  i would say that this is not a major issue  but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom1it has a 3x optical zoom  which is average for these cameras  for more  you sacrifice weight and size  more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length  it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom  but you sacrifice quality  i set the camera to the  manual  mode for one main reason  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries  in manual  you can set it to  single af  where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic  this is not really a hinderance  you just have to be familiar with its menus and features  in reality  these are the only drawbacks this camera has  much less than many other models  it is easy to  focus  in on the drawbacks  so do nt think i hate this camera  camera it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for generalto moderate snapping  for work  we use them in the field often  and they hold up really well  macro they take excellent macro shots as well  menu the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access  and it takes silent movies   i compared this to a lot of other cameras  believe me  it s value for money  picture the picturers are amazing  do nt waste time looking at anything else  just buy this one  it do nt get any better then the nikon 4300   function recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card  as expected  i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m4m pixel  fine combos and many of the userfriendly functions are very similar to slr models  and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately  txt file i particularly like the  txt  file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take size uthe compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them  try to buy a high capacity ultra card  as it s 2x as faster as the regular cf card  consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download  it s well worth the little extra money  an extra rechargeable enel 1 battery is also handy  so you will seldom run into  out of battery  situation  use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run  one thing puzzles me is that for  fine and 2200   quality pictures  one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130140 pics  but the size of the pictures are only around 12 mb  the math does not add up  i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 12 mbper  anybody can explain that  nikon a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories  as always   ","negative":""}

use the camera  rechargable battery comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit  included  is fast and small  i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery  so it s good to go on a long vacation  camera i enthusiastically recommend this camera   p use u feature it s easy to use  and yet very feature rich  auto mode scene mode in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click  the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results  manual mode the manual mode is feature rich and i can t wait to get the hang of it  macro mode picture the macro mode is exceptional  the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject  battery life the battery life is very good  i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time  the first time around  and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then  and have yet needed to recharge it  the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card  which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution  i intend to buy a bigger card soon    use i fell in love with this camera  it combines ease of use  with an immense amount of options and power  you can use the scene modes  or fine tune the options  i you can change the iso level  shutter speed  etc camera this camera is ideal for people who want more power  but do nt want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera   with nikon  although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras  i ve had the following headaches  transfer21  pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable  i did everything i could  and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader  card reader is included  2  the speed is noticeably slower than canon  especially so with flashes on  3  with low battery  it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip  i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar  be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries    picture  closeup shooting but overall this is a good camera with a  really good  picture clarity  an exceptional closeup shooting capability  i would rate this is 45 stars picture quality  image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix   customer service2it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality  but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service   delay otherwise  it takes very good pictures  shutter delay is nt so bad either  still  had to send it back to nikon for repair   nikon 4300  i feel  is the best camera out there for the features and price  here were my requirements in a digital camera  1  i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6  or 5x7  prints and i wanted some really great 8x10  photos once in a while  2  i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was nt comfortable with that  i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily  3  i wanted a camera that had a lot of builtin settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although  i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings  4  and  of course  i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had nt used it much  depending on all the above requirements  i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models  nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes  medium compact size  price  brand name  good software that is included and previous reviews  i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since  picture the pictures are absolutely amazing  the camera captures the minutest of details  a few things that might make it even better  indoor picture11  pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay2u2  it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow  picture23  the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture  all the above  i think  are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints  try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems  whichever camera you buy  add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card  usb card reader  camera bag and the warranty  and finally  get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra  no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness  hope this review has helped you in making up your mind  i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience  i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now    manual mode  scene mode the possibilities with auto  manual  and the very helpful  scene  mode  which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait  landscape  beach  snow  sunset etc  are endless  movie mode the movie mode is also working great  software the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem  battery charger  usb and video cable  a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on  normal  resolution  print i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers  and they both delivered great results  print even at the  normal  setting  a 8x10 print  shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels  you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a  digital   battery life the battery life is ok  but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on  i therefore bought a second battery as a backup  and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger  which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe  we ran never out of  juice   i highly recommend the accessory kit  which provides you with everything else you need  a nice camera bag  which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger  furher it contains a card reader  a flash card folder for up to 8 cards  a lense cleaning rag  and an ac adapter  which is very helpful when working in an  outlet environment   camera over all a fantastic very compact camera  which made us experience photography on a totally new level   after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures  digital zoom optical zoom the digital zoom takes as good of pictures  as the optical zoom does  picture2the inside pics  can be a bit challenging  but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like  that are not focused perfectly  or need lighting adjustments  make this camera very simple and effective  feature i love all of the features  and presets as well  sunset feature sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning  and the evening  software the software you get with this camera is perfect  touchup  redeye touchups  redeye  and so on are very easy to alter  and correct  i definately recommend a large memory card  i use a 128mb card  and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 10241280 res  with good resolution  very large pics take 8mb each  battery life battery life is good  although i recommend two rechargebles  or a alkaline backup  for those emergency pics you have to have  camera all and all  i am extremely pleased with this camera  making the step from film to digital has been a great move  i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know  camera great camera  great investment   uquality size the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful  easy to use  high quality  and compact in size  with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation  auto setting the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them  if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300  i would order another just like it   pit has many great features and very few bad ones  picture ease of use it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use  if you read the manual  if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual  lcd1the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too  download downloads are a snap and quick  control controls easy yo use and easy to get to  camera i m extremely glad i bought this camera   really happy with this little camera  size uit is nt big and offensive  though you would nt know it by looking at the pics it takes  got it for christmas  still learning a few of the settings  but i do nt take pictures every single day  picture print settings for just about everything  beautiful pics and beautiful prints  zoomed image i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy  but onfull size high to fine quality  the zoomed images are quite impressive  did buy a 256mb compact flash  it holds a lot of pics at any resolution  i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions  but does nt seem any of the buget cameras do  camera still  at least from my perspective  a great camera for the money  and i m a happy camper   this is a wonderful camera  my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months  in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer s remorse  4mp optical zoom 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience  cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera  3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price  picture one neat thing  i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms  no problem for the camera  rooms looked like they had ample lighting   this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much  software  online service the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95  of all photos taken by a beginner  100  perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos  i took the camera and just gave it to someone  no instructions  photo just point and shoot and the photos were great  just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos  memory card the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla  my pda becames a digital album  i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos  camera if you have to buy a camera on a buget this has got to be the one  go get it  before they are sold out   great camera  i have been using this for several months and got excellent results  simple friendly usage  in many scenes indoor  outdoor  snow  close up macro etc   feature this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has  use uit is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into  macro i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots  picture quality my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took  autofocus2one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low  i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life battery life is ok  i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it   great camera  and for the price you can t beat it  i ve been using it for about 3 months now  control i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly  quality the quality is superb  size the small size is perfect for my little hands  but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person   the 4300 is a very durable  compact package  and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust  it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade  we got a 256mb card  and have been hardpressed to fill it over a weekend  the only drawbacks that i have noticed  battery2it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long  especially if you use the flash a lot  so  it s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  autofocus assist light1it does not have an autofocus assist light which is nice for taking shots in lowlight situations it allows the camera to focus in low light  i would say that this is not a major issue  but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom1it has a 3x optical zoom  which is average for these cameras  for more  you sacrifice weight and size  more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length  it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom  but you sacrifice quality  i set the camera to the  manual  mode for one main reason  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries  in manual  you can set it to  single af  where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic  this is not really a hinderance  you just have to be familiar with its menus and features  in reality  these are the only drawbacks this camera has  much less than many other models  it is easy to  focus  in on the drawbacks  so do nt think i hate this camera  camera it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for generalto moderate snapping  for work  we use them in the field often  and they hold up really well  macro they take excellent macro shots as well  menu the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access  and it takes silent movies   i compared this to a lot of other cameras  believe me  it s value for money  picture the picturers are amazing  do nt waste time looking at anything else  just buy this one  it do nt get any better then the nikon 4300   function recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card  as expected  i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m4m pixel  fine combos and many of the userfriendly functions are very similar to slr models  and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately  txt file i particularly like the  txt  file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take size uthe compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them  try to buy a high capacity ultra card  as it s 2x as faster as the regular cf card  consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download  it s well worth the little extra money  an extra rechargeable enel 1 battery is also handy  so you will seldom run into  out of battery  situation  use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run  one thing puzzles me is that for  fine and 2200   quality pictures  one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130140 pics  but the size of the pictures are only around 12 mb  the math does not add up  i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 12 mbper  anybody can explain that  nikon a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories  as always   picture i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate  picture quality we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken  camera i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you downnow buy it   i have it for a week now  and this camera has exceeded my expectations  picture indoor shot the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away  the shutter lag is on par with what i ve experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me  and it was only a few dollars more  image download uuploading the images to my windowsbased pc is very fast and simple  indoor shot1the only drawbacks i ve encountered are  1 indoor shots from a distance  8ft lack contrast and color  but i ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with builtin flashes that i ve used even on a nikon slr  right now  i m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that s designed for digital cameras  battery life12 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations  i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died  an extra for a backup battery would be a good investment  software13 the picture editing software it came with is adequate  but not very robust  i ll still use my photosuite for editing  one more thing about indoor shots  many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing  just for the heck of it  i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door  and the focusing was just fine  camera in summary  i love this camera and would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range   since i wrote the review above in january 2003  i still love this camera  i ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful  i bought a digislave dsf1s flash unit  i do nt use a bracket  i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand  i also got a ure 4 step down ring adapter  lce 900 lens cap  and the nikon 28mm filter set  this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters  i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time  this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap  the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on  the camera wo nt fit in the small cases  and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find   ","negative":""}

especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them  try to buy a high capacity ultra card  as it s 2x as faster as the regular cf card  consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download  it s well worth the little extra money  an extra rechargeable enel 1 battery is also handy  so you will seldom run into  out of battery  situation  use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run  one thing puzzles me is that for  fine and 2200   quality pictures  one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130140 pics  but the size of the pictures are only around 12 mb  the math does not add up  i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 12 mbper  anybody can explain that  nikon a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories  as always   picture i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate  picture quality we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken  camera i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you downnow buy it   i have it for a week now  and this camera has exceeded my expectations  picture indoor shot the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away  the shutter lag is on par with what i ve experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me  and it was only a few dollars more  image download uuploading the images to my windowsbased pc is very fast and simple  indoor shot1the only drawbacks i ve encountered are  1 indoor shots from a distance  8ft lack contrast and color  but i ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with builtin flashes that i ve used even on a nikon slr  right now  i m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that s designed for digital cameras  battery life12 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations  i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died  an extra for a backup battery would be a good investment  software13 the picture editing software it came with is adequate  but not very robust  i ll still use my photosuite for editing  one more thing about indoor shots  many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing  just for the heck of it  i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door  and the focusing was just fine  camera in summary  i love this camera and would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range   since i wrote the review above in january 2003  i still love this camera  i ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful  i bought a digislave dsf1s flash unit  i do nt use a bracket  i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand  i also got a ure 4 step down ring adapter  lce 900 lens cap  and the nikon 28mm filter set  this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters  i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time  this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap  the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on  the camera wo nt fit in the small cases  and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find   great camera  use i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture it takes great pictures  manual the manual is easy to understand  and it is mostly idiot proof  size uit is small  unlike my canon slr  so it easily fits in my pocket  i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots  now where did i put that manual   ","negative":""}

dummyproof  and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera  rechargable battery comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit  included  is fast and small  i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery  so it s good to go on a long vacation  camera i enthusiastically recommend this camera   p use u feature it s easy to use  and yet very feature rich  auto mode scene mode in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click  the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results  manual mode the manual mode is feature rich and i can t wait to get the hang of it  macro mode picture the macro mode is exceptional  the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject  battery life the battery life is very good  i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time  the first time around  and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then  and have yet needed to recharge it  the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card  which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution  i intend to buy a bigger card soon    use i fell in love with this camera  it combines ease of use  with an immense amount of options and power  you can use the scene modes  or fine tune the options  i you can change the iso level  shutter speed  etc camera this camera is ideal for people who want more power  but do nt want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera   with nikon  although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras  i ve had the following headaches  transfer21  pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable  i did everything i could  and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader  card reader is included  2  the speed is noticeably slower than canon  especially so with flashes on  3  with low battery  it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip  i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar  be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries    picture  closeup shooting but overall this is a good camera with a  really good  picture clarity  an exceptional closeup shooting capability  i would rate this is 45 stars picture quality  image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix   customer service2it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality  but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service   delay otherwise  it takes very good pictures  shutter delay is nt so bad either  still  had to send it back to nikon for repair   nikon 4300  i feel  is the best camera out there for the features and price  here were my requirements in a digital camera  1  i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6  or 5x7  prints and i wanted some really great 8x10  photos once in a while  2  i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was nt comfortable with that  i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily  3  i wanted a camera that had a lot of builtin settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although  i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings  4  and  of course  i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had nt used it much  depending on all the above requirements  i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models  nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes  medium compact size  price  brand name  good software that is included and previous reviews  i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since  picture the pictures are absolutely amazing  the camera captures the minutest of details  a few things that might make it even better  indoor picture11  pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay2u2  it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow  picture23  the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture  all the above  i think  are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints  try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems  whichever camera you buy  add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card  usb card reader  camera bag and the warranty  and finally  get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra  no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness  hope this review has helped you in making up your mind  i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience  i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now    manual mode  scene mode the possibilities with auto  manual  and the very helpful  scene  mode  which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait  landscape  beach  snow  sunset etc  are endless  movie mode the movie mode is also working great  software the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem  battery charger  usb and video cable  a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on  normal  resolution  print i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers  and they both delivered great results  print even at the  normal  setting  a 8x10 print  shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels  you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a  digital   battery life the battery life is ok  but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on  i therefore bought a second battery as a backup  and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger  which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe  we ran never out of  juice   i highly recommend the accessory kit  which provides you with everything else you need  a nice camera bag  which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger  furher it contains a card reader  a flash card folder for up to 8 cards  a lense cleaning rag  and an ac adapter  which is very helpful when working in an  outlet environment   camera over all a fantastic very compact camera  which made us experience photography on a totally new level   after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures  digital zoom optical zoom the digital zoom takes as good of pictures  as the optical zoom does  picture2the inside pics  can be a bit challenging  but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like  that are not focused perfectly  or need lighting adjustments  make this camera very simple and effective  feature i love all of the features  and presets as well  sunset feature sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning  and the evening  software the software you get with this camera is perfect  touchup  redeye touchups  redeye  and so on are very easy to alter  and correct  i definately recommend a large memory card  i use a 128mb card  and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 10241280 res  with good resolution  very large pics take 8mb each  battery life battery life is good  although i recommend two rechargebles  or a alkaline backup  for those emergency pics you have to have  camera all and all  i am extremely pleased with this camera  making the step from film to digital has been a great move  i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know  camera great camera  great investment   uquality size the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful  easy to use  high quality  and compact in size  with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation  auto setting the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them  if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300  i would order another just like it   pit has many great features and very few bad ones  picture ease of use it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use  if you read the manual  if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual  lcd1the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too  download downloads are a snap and quick  control controls easy yo use and easy to get to  camera i m extremely glad i bought this camera   really happy with this little camera  size uit is nt big and offensive  though you would nt know it by looking at the pics it takes  got it for christmas  still learning a few of the settings  but i do nt take pictures every single day  picture print settings for just about everything  beautiful pics and beautiful prints  zoomed image i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy  but onfull size high to fine quality  the zoomed images are quite impressive  did buy a 256mb compact flash  it holds a lot of pics at any resolution  i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions  but does nt seem any of the buget cameras do  camera still  at least from my perspective  a great camera for the money  and i m a happy camper   this is a wonderful camera  my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months  in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer s remorse  4mp optical zoom 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience  cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera  3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price  picture one neat thing  i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms  no problem for the camera  rooms looked like they had ample lighting   this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much  software  online service the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95  of all photos taken by a beginner  100  perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos  i took the camera and just gave it to someone  no instructions  photo just point and shoot and the photos were great  just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos  memory card the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla  my pda becames a digital album  i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos  camera if you have to buy a camera on a buget this has got to be the one  go get it  before they are sold out   great camera  i have been using this for several months and got excellent results  simple friendly usage  in many scenes indoor  outdoor  snow  close up macro etc   feature this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has  use uit is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into  macro i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots  picture quality my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took  autofocus2one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low  i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life battery life is ok  i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it   great camera  and for the price you can t beat it  i ve been using it for about 3 months now  control i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly  quality the quality is superb  size the small size is perfect for my little hands  but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person   the 4300 is a very durable  compact package  and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust  it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade  we got a 256mb card  and have been hardpressed to fill it over a weekend  the only drawbacks that i have noticed  battery2it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long  especially if you use the flash a lot  so  it s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  autofocus assist light1it does not have an autofocus assist light which is nice for taking shots in lowlight situations it allows the camera to focus in low light  i would say that this is not a major issue  but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom1it has a 3x optical zoom  which is average for these cameras  for more  you sacrifice weight and size  more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length  it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom  but you sacrifice quality  i set the camera to the  manual  mode for one main reason  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries  in manual  you can set it to  single af  where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic  this is not really a hinderance  you just have to be familiar with its menus and features  in reality  these are the only drawbacks this camera has  much less than many other models  it is easy to  focus  in on the drawbacks  so do nt think i hate this camera  camera it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for generalto moderate snapping  for work  we use them in the field often  and they hold up really well  macro they take excellent macro shots as well  menu the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access  and it takes silent movies   i compared this to a lot of other cameras  believe me  it s value for money  picture the picturers are amazing  do nt waste time looking at anything else  just buy this one  it do nt get any better then the nikon 4300   function recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card  as expected  i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with

dscp 9  but at the camera shop  realized this one went above and beyond  picture quality i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time  autofocus scene mode manual mode autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all  i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash

manual  lcd1the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too  download downloads are a snap and quick  control controls easy yo use and easy to get to  camera i m extremely glad i bought this camera   really happy with this little camera  size uit is nt big and offensive  though you would nt know it by looking at the pics it takes  got it for christmas  still learning a few of the settings  but i do nt take pictures every single day  picture print settings for just about everything  beautiful pics and beautiful prints  zoomed image i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy  but onfull size high to fine quality  the zoomed images are quite impressive  did buy a 256mb compact flash  it holds a lot of pics at any resolution  i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions  but does nt seem any of the buget cameras do  camera still  at least from my perspective  a great camera for the money  and i m a happy camper   this is a wonderful camera  my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months  in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer s remorse  4mp optical zoom 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience  cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera  3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price  picture one neat thing  i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms  no problem for the camera  rooms looked like they had ample lighting   this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much  software  online service the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95  of all photos taken by a beginner  100  perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos  i took the camera and just gave it to someone  no instructions  photo just point and shoot and the photos were great  just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos  memory card the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla  my pda becames a digital album  i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos  camera if you have to buy a camera on a buget this has got to be the one  go get it  before they are sold out   great camera  i have been using this for several months and got excellent results  simple friendly usage  in many scenes indoor  outdoor  snow  close up macro etc   feature this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has  use uit is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into  macro i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots  picture quality my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took  autofocus2one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low  i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life battery life is ok  i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it   great camera  and for the price you can t beat it  i ve been using it for about 3 months now  control i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly  quality the quality is superb  size the small size is perfect for my little hands  but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person   the 4300 is a very durable  compact package  and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust  it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade  we got a 256mb card  and have been hardpressed to fill it over a weekend  the only drawbacks that i have noticed  battery2it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long  especially if you use the flash a lot  so  it s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  autofocus assist light1it does not have an autofocus assist light which is nice for taking shots in lowlight situations it allows the camera to focus in low light  i would say that this is not a major issue  but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom1it has a 3x optical zoom  which is average for these cameras  for more  you sacrifice weight and size  more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length  it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom  but you sacrifice quality  i set the camera to the  manual  mode for one main reason  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries  in manual  you can set it to  single af  where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic  this is not really a hinderance  you just have to be familiar with its menus and features  in reality  these are the only drawbacks this camera has  much less than many other models  it is easy to  focus  in on the drawbacks  so do nt think i hate this camera  camera it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for generalto moderate snapping  for work  we use them in the field often  and they hold up really well  macro they take excellent macro shots as well  menu the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access  and it takes silent movies   i compared this to a lot of other cameras  believe me  it s value for money  picture the picturers are amazing  do nt waste time looking at anything else  just buy this one  it do nt get any better then the nikon 4300   function recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card  as expected  i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m4m pixel  fine combos and many of the userfriendly functions are very similar to slr models  and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately  txt file i particularly like the  txt  file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take size uthe compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them  try to buy a high capacity ultra card  as it s 2x as faster as the regular cf card  consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download  it s well worth the little extra money  an extra rechargeable enel 1 battery is also handy  so you will seldom run into  out of battery  situation  use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run  one thing puzzles me is that for  fine and 2200   quality pictures  one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130140 pics  but the size of the pictures are only around 12 mb  the math does not add up  i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 12 mbper  anybody can explain that  nikon a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories  as always   picture i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate  picture quality we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken  camera i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you downnow buy it   i have it for a week now  and this camera has exceeded my expectations  picture indoor shot the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away  the shutter lag is on par with what i ve experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me  and it was only a few dollars more  image download uuploading the images to my windowsbased pc is very fast and simple  indoor shot1the only drawbacks i ve encountered are  1 indoor shots from a distance  8ft lack contrast and color  but i ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with builtin flashes that i ve used even on a nikon slr  right now  i m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that s designed for digital cameras  battery life12 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations  i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died  an extra for a backup battery would be a good investment  software13 the picture editing software it came with is adequate  but not very robust  i ll still use my photosuite for editing  one more thing about indoor shots  many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing  just for the heck of it  i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door  and the focusing was just fine  camera in summary  i love this camera and would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range   since i wrote the review above in january 2003  i still love this camera  i ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful  i bought a digislave dsf1s flash unit  i do nt use a bracket  i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand  i also got a ure 4 step down ring adapter  lce 900 lens cap  and the nikon 28mm filter set  this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters  i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time  this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap  the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on  the camera wo nt fit in the small cases  and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find   great camera  use i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture it takes great pictures  manual the manual is easy to understand  and it is mostly idiot proof  size uit is small  unlike my canon slr  so it easily fits in my pocket  i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots  now where did i put that manual   i got this camera about a month ago and i can t put it down  i was considering buying the minolta f100 and the sony dscp 9  but at the camera shop  realized this one went above and beyond  picture quality i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time  autofocus scene mode manual mode autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all  i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card  buy this camera and savour it   pi have not been disappointed with my purchase  picture quality picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm  indoor shot2on average  indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm  however  the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures  camera i am extremely satisfied with this camera  i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion  buy an extra battery  life is good but still somewhat short  do nt buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card  you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution  i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera s controls are confusing and hard to remember  read the directions  the regular mode in this camera works for 80  of settings  scene mode the  scene  mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a  regular  setting  i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos  optical setting however  its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70  of the shots that i take  buy this camera  you wo nt regret it   ","negative":""}
{"id":28,"title":"digital nirvana camera","positive":"this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer  picture  macro the pictures are razorsharp  even in macro  size uit is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse  weight uit is light enough to carry around all day without bother  feature uoperating its many features is easy and often obvious  i m no annie lebovitz  but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store  manual the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain  auto focus scene mode the autofocus performs well  but i love having the 12 optional scene modes  they are dummyproof  and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera  rechargable battery comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit  included  is fast and small  i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery  so it s good to go on a long vacation  camera i enthusiastically recommend this camera   p use u feature it s easy to use  and yet very feature rich  auto mode scene mode in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click  the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results  manual mode the manual mode is feature rich and i can t wait to get the hang of it  macro mode picture the macro mode is exceptional  the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject  battery life the battery life is very good  i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time  the first time around  and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then  and have yet needed to recharge it  the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card  which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution  i intend to buy a bigger card soon    use i fell in love with this camera  it combines ease of use  with an immense amount of options and power  you can use the scene modes  or fine tune the options  i you can change the iso level  shutter speed  etc camera this camera is ideal for people who want more power  but do nt want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera   with nikon  although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras  i ve had the following headaches  transfer21  pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable  i did everything i could  and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader  card reader is included  2  the speed is noticeably slower than canon  especially so with flashes on  3  with low battery  it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip  i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar  be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries    picture  closeup shooting but overall this is a good camera with a  really good  picture clarity  an exceptional closeup shooting capability  i would rate this is 45 stars picture quality  image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix   customer service2it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality  but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service   delay otherwise  it takes very good pictures  shutter delay is nt so bad either  still  had to send it back to nikon for repair   nikon 4300  i feel  is the best camera out there for the features and price  here were my requirements in a digital camera  1  i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6  or 5x7  prints and i wanted some really great 8x10  photos once in a while  2  i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was nt comfortable with that  i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily  3  i wanted a camera that had a lot of builtin settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although  i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings  4  and  of course  i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had nt used it much  depending on all the above requirements  i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models  nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes  medium compact size  price  brand name  good software that is included and previous reviews  i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since  picture the pictures are absolutely amazing  the camera captures the minutest of details  a few things that might make it even better  indoor picture11  pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay2u2  it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow  picture23  the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture  all the above  i think  are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints  try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems  whichever camera you buy  add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card  usb card reader  camera bag and the warranty  and finally  get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra  no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness  hope this review has helped you in making up your mind  i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience  i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now    manual mode  scene mode the possibilities with auto  manual  and the very helpful  scene  mode  which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait  landscape  beach  snow  sunset etc  are endless  movie mode the movie mode is also working great  software the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem  battery charger  usb and video cable  a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on  normal  resolution  print i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers  and they both delivered great results  print even at the  normal  setting  a 8x10 print  shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels  you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a  digital   battery life the battery life is ok  but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on  i therefore bought a second battery as a backup  and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger  which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe  we ran never out of  juice   i highly recommend the accessory kit  which provides you with everything else you need  a nice camera bag  which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger  furher it contains a card reader  a flash card folder for up to 8 cards  a lense cleaning rag  and an ac adapter  which is very helpful when working in an  outlet environment   camera over all a fantastic very compact camera  which made us experience photography on a totally new level   after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures  digital zoom optical zoom the digital zoom takes as good of pictures  as the optical zoom does  picture2the inside pics  can be a bit challenging  but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like  that are not focused perfectly  or need lighting adjustments  make this camera very simple and effective  feature i love all of the features  and presets as well  sunset feature sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning  and the evening  software the software you get with this camera is perfect  touchup  redeye touchups  redeye  and so on are very easy to alter  and correct  i definately recommend a large memory card  i use a 128mb card  and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 10241280 res  with good resolution  very large pics take 8mb each  battery life battery life is good  although i recommend two rechargebles  or a alkaline backup  for those emergency pics you have to have  camera all and all  i am extremely pleased with this camera  making the step from film to digital has been a great move  i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know  camera great camera  great investment   uquality size the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful  easy to use  high quality  and compact in size  with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation

in the medium price range   since i wrote the review above in january 2003  i still love this camera  i ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful  i bought a digislave dsf1s flash unit

the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on  the camera wo nt fit in the small cases  and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find   great camera  use i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture it takes great pictures  manual the manual is easy to understand  and it is mostly idiot proof  size uit is small  unlike my canon slr  so it

short  do nt buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card  you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution  i have one thing to say to the

works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a  regular  setting  i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos  optical setting however  its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70  of the shots that i take  buy this camera  you wo nt regret it   if you re looking for a small  compact  super resolution digital camera  you can end your

small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was nt comfortable with that  i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily  3  i wanted a camera that had a lot of builtin settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although  i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual

glow  picture23  the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture  all the above  i think  are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints  try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems  whichever camera you buy  add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card  usb card reader  camera bag and the warranty  and finally  get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra  no one can beat kodak

battery as a backup  and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger  which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe  we ran never out of  juice   i highly recommend the accessory kit  which provides you with everything else you need  a nice camera bag  which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger  furher it contains a card reader  a flash card folder for up to 8 cards  a lense cleaning rag  and an ac adapter  which is very helpful when working in an  outlet environment   camera over all a fantastic very compact camera  which made us experience

emergency pics you have to have  camera all and all  i am extremely pleased with this camera  making the step from film to digital has been a great move  i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know  camera great camera  great investment   uquality size the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful  easy to use  high quality  and compact in size  with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation  auto setting the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them  if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300  i would order another just like it   pit has many great features and very few bad ones  picture ease of use it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use  if you read the manual  if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual  lcd1the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too  download downloads are a snap and quick  control controls easy yo use and easy to get to  camera i m extremely glad i bought this camera   really happy with this little camera  size uit is nt big and offensive  though you would nt know it by looking at the pics it takes  got it for christmas  still learning a few of the settings  but i do nt take pictures every single day  picture print settings for just about everything  beautiful pics and beautiful prints  zoomed image i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy  but onfull size high to fine quality  the zoomed images are quite impressive  did buy a 256mb compact flash  it holds a lot of pics at any resolution  i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions  but does nt seem any of the buget cameras do  camera still  at least from my perspective  a great camera for the money  and i m a happy camper   this is a wonderful camera  my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months  in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer s remorse  4mp optical zoom 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience  cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera  3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price  picture one neat thing  i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms  no problem for the camera  rooms looked like they had ample lighting   this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much  software  online service the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95  of all photos taken by a beginner  100  perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos  i took the camera and just gave it to someone  no instructions  photo just point and shoot and the photos were great  just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos  memory card the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla  my pda becames a digital album  i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos  camera if you have to buy a camera on a buget this has got to be the one  go get it  before they are sold out   great camera  i have been using this for several months and got excellent results  simple friendly usage  in many scenes indoor  outdoor  snow  close up macro etc   feature this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has  use uit is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into  macro i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots  picture quality my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took  autofocus2one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low  i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life battery life is ok  i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it   great camera  and for the price you can t beat it  i ve been using it for about 3 months now  control i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly  quality the quality is superb  size the small size is perfect for my little hands  but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person   the 4300 is a very durable  compact package  and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust  it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade  we got a 256mb card  and have been hardpressed to fill it over a weekend  the only drawbacks that i have noticed  battery2it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long  especially if you use the flash a lot  so  it s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  autofocus assist light1it does not have an autofocus assist light which is nice for taking shots in lowlight situations it allows the camera to focus in low light  i would say that this is not a major issue  but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom1it has a 3x optical zoom  which is average for these cameras  for more  you sacrifice weight and size  more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length  it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom  but you sacrifice quality  i set the camera to the  manual  mode for one main reason  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries  in manual  you can set it to  single af  where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic  this is not really a hinderance  you just have to be familiar with its menus and features  in reality  these are the only drawbacks this camera has  much less than many other models  it is easy to  focus  in on the drawbacks  so do nt think i hate this camera  camera it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for generalto moderate snapping  for work  we use them in the field often  and they hold up really well  macro they take excellent macro shots as well  menu the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access  and it takes silent movies   i compared this to a lot of other cameras  believe me  it s value for money  picture the picturers are amazing  do nt waste time looking at anything else  just buy this one  it do nt get any better then the nikon 4300   function recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card  as expected  i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m4m pixel  fine combos and many of the userfriendly functions are very similar to slr models  and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately  txt file i particularly like the  txt  file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take size uthe compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them  try to buy a high capacity ultra card  as it s 2x as faster as the regular cf card  consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download  it s well worth the little extra money  an extra rechargeable enel 1 battery is also handy  so you will seldom run into  out of battery  situation  use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run  one thing puzzles me is that for  fine and 2200   quality pictures  one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130140 pics  but the size of the pictures are only around 12 mb  the math does not add up  i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 12 mbper  anybody can explain that  nikon a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories  as always   picture i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate  picture quality we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken  camera i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you downnow buy it   i have it for a week now  and this camera has exceeded my expectations  picture indoor shot the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away  the shutter lag is on par with what i ve experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me  and it was only a few dollars more  image download uuploading the images to my windowsbased pc is very fast and simple  indoor shot1the only drawbacks i ve encountered are  1 indoor shots from a distance  8ft lack contrast and color  but i ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with builtin flashes that i ve used even on a nikon slr  right now  i m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that s designed for digital cameras  battery life12 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations  i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died  an extra for a backup battery would be a good investment  software13 the picture editing software it came with is adequate  but not very robust  i ll still use my photosuite for editing  one more thing about indoor shots  many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing  just for the heck of it  i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door  and the focusing was just fine  camera in summary  i love this camera and would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range   since i wrote the review above in january 2003  i still love this camera  i ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful  i bought a digislave dsf1s flash unit  i do nt use a bracket  i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand  i also got a ure 4 step down ring adapter  lce 900 lens cap  and the nikon 28mm filter set  this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters  i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time  this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap  the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on  the camera wo nt fit in the small cases  and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find   great camera  use i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture it takes great pictures  manual the manual is easy to understand  and it is mostly idiot proof  size uit is small  unlike my canon slr  so it easily fits in my pocket  i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots  now where did i put that manual   i got this camera about a month ago and i can t put it down  i was considering buying the minolta f100 and the sony dscp 9  but at the camera shop  realized this one went above and beyond  picture quality i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time  autofocus scene mode manual mode autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all  i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card  buy this camera and savour it   pi have not been disappointed with my purchase  picture quality picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm  indoor shot2on average  indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm  however  the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures  camera i am extremely satisfied with this camera  i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion  buy an extra battery  life is good but still somewhat short  do nt buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card  you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution  i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera s controls are confusing and hard to remember  read the directions  the regular mode in this camera works for 80  of settings  scene mode the  scene  mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a  regular  setting  i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos  optical setting however  its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70  of the shots that i take  buy this camera  you wo nt regret it   if you re looking for a small  compact  super resolution digital camera  you can end your search with the nikon 4300  picture quality after a lengthy and extensive journey for a featureloaded  high performance  travel size camera  i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel  nikon after using it for about a month  i can state unequivocably that

knew i could love a digital camera so much  software  online service the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95  of all photos taken by a beginner  100  perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos  i took the camera and just gave it to someone  no instructions  photo just point and shoot and the photos were great  just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos  memory card the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla  my pda becames a digital album  i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos  camera if you have to buy a camera on a buget this has got to be the one  go get it  before they are sold out   great camera  i have been using this for several months and got excellent results  simple friendly usage  in many scenes indoor  outdoor  snow  close up macro etc   feature this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has  use uit is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into  macro i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots  picture quality my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took  autofocus2one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low  i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life battery life is ok  i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it   great camera  and for the price you can t beat it  i ve been using it for about 3 months now  control i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly  quality the quality is superb  size the small size is perfect for my little hands  but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person   the 4300 is a very durable  compact package  and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust  it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade  we got a 256mb card  and have been hardpressed to fill it over a weekend  the only drawbacks that i have noticed  battery2it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long  especially if you use the flash a lot  so  it s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  autofocus assist light1it does not have an autofocus assist light which is nice for taking shots in lowlight situations it allows the camera to focus in low light  i would say that this is not a major issue  but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom1it has a 3x optical zoom  which is average for these cameras  for more  you sacrifice weight and size  more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length  it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom  but you sacrifice quality  i set the camera to the  manual  mode for one main reason  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries  in manual  you can set it to  single af  where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic  this is not really a hinderance  you just have to be familiar with its menus and features  in reality  these are the only drawbacks this camera has  much less than many other models  it is easy to  focus  in on the drawbacks  so do nt think i hate this camera  camera it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for generalto moderate snapping  for work  we use them in the field often  and they hold up really well  macro they take excellent macro shots as well  menu the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access  and it takes silent movies   i compared this to a lot of other cameras  believe me  it s value for money  picture the picturers are amazing  do nt waste time looking at anything else  just buy this one  it do nt get any better then the nikon 4300   function recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card  as expected  i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m4m pixel  fine combos and many of the userfriendly functions are very similar to slr models  and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately  txt file i particularly like the  txt  file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take size uthe compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them  try to buy a high capacity ultra card  as it s 2x as faster as the regular cf card  consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download  it s well worth the little extra money  an extra rechargeable enel 1 battery is also handy  so you will seldom run into  out of battery  situation  use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run  one thing puzzles me is that for  fine and 2200   quality pictures  one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130140 pics  but the size of the pictures are only around 12 mb  the math does not add up  i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 12 mbper  anybody can explain that  nikon a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories  as always   picture i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate  picture quality we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken  camera i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you downnow buy it   i have it for a week now  and this camera has exceeded my expectations  picture indoor shot the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away  the shutter lag is on par with what i ve experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me  and it was only a few dollars more  image download uuploading the images to my windowsbased pc is very fast and simple  indoor shot1the only drawbacks i ve encountered are  1 indoor shots from a distance  8ft lack contrast and color  but i ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with builtin flashes that i ve used even on a nikon slr  right now  i m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that s designed for digital cameras  battery life12 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations  i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died  an extra for a backup battery would be a good investment  software13 the picture editing software it came with is adequate  but not very robust  i ll still use my photosuite for editing  one more thing about indoor shots  many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing  just for the heck of it  i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door  and the focusing was just fine  camera in summary  i love this camera and would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range   since i wrote the review above in january 2003  i still love this camera  i ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful  i bought a digislave dsf1s flash unit  i do nt use a bracket  i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand  i also got a ure 4 step down ring adapter  lce 900 lens cap  and the nikon 28mm filter set  this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters  i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time  this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap  the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on  the camera wo nt fit in the small cases  and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find   great camera  use i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture it takes great pictures  manual the manual is easy to understand  and it is mostly idiot proof  size uit is small  unlike my canon slr  so it easily fits in my pocket  i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots  now where did i put that manual   i got this camera about a month ago and i can t put it down  i was considering buying the minolta f100 and the sony dscp 9  but at the camera shop  realized this one went above and beyond  picture quality i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time  autofocus scene mode manual mode autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all  i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card  buy this camera and savour it   pi have not been disappointed with my purchase  picture quality picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm  indoor shot2on average  indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm  however  the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures  camera i am extremely satisfied with this camera  i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion  buy an extra battery  life is good but still somewhat short  do nt buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card  you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution  i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera s controls are confusing and hard to remember  read the directions  the regular mode in this camera works for 80  of settings  scene mode the  scene  mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a  regular  setting  i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos  optical setting however  its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70  of the shots that i take  buy this camera  you wo nt regret it   if you re looking for a small  compact  super resolution digital camera  you can end your search with the nikon 4300  picture quality after a lengthy and extensive journey for a featureloaded  high performance  travel size camera  i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel  nikon after using it for about a month  i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck  use  accessory its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wideangle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake  picture quality feature yes  the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range  design construction optic the design and construction are excellent  as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics  i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital  if you re seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer s remorse and filled with cool  then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300   there are so many functions in this little  yet powerful camera   pseriously  i love it  my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera  they came out black  but with this  they look the same in the picture as in real life  better actually cause my carpet looks clean  lol  camera but this camera is great  picture quality movie the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to  i can t connect it to my computer though  but that s a problem with windows me  not the camera  if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway  lol  but it works perfectly fine on my parent s computer  lense cap it does have a lense cap  but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good  battery the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice  camera ooh  and i dropped it and it still works fine  this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet   ","negative":""}
{"id":31,"title":"excellent little camera i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera  and this one had everything i was looking for  use","positive":"this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer  picture  macro the pictures are razorsharp  even in macro  size uit is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse  weight uit is light enough to carry around all day without bother  feature uoperating its many features is easy and often obvious  i m no annie lebovitz  but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store  manual the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain  auto focus scene mode the autofocus performs well  but i love having the 12 optional scene modes  they are dummyproof  and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera  rechargable battery comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit  included  is fast and small  i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery  so it s good to go on a long vacation  camera i enthusiastically recommend this camera   p use u feature it s easy to use  and yet very feature rich  auto mode scene mode in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click  the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results  manual mode the manual mode is feature rich and i can t wait to get the hang of it  macro mode picture the macro mode is exceptional  the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject  battery life the battery life is very good  i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time  the first time around  and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then  and have yet needed to recharge it  the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card  which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution  i intend to buy a bigger card soon    use i fell in love with this camera  it combines ease of use  with an immense amount of options and power  you can use the scene modes  or fine tune the options  i you can change the iso level  shutter speed  etc camera this camera is ideal for people who want more power  but do nt want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera   with nikon  although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras  i ve had the following headaches  transfer21  pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable  i did everything i could  and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader  card reader is included  2  the speed is noticeably slower than canon  especially so with flashes on  3  with low battery  it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip  i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar  be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries    picture  closeup shooting but overall this is a good camera with a  really good  picture clarity  an exceptional closeup shooting capability  i would rate this is 45 stars picture quality  image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix   customer service2it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality  but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service   delay otherwise  it takes very good pictures  shutter delay is nt so bad either  still  had to send it back to nikon for repair   nikon 4300  i feel  is the best camera out there for the features and price  here were my requirements in a digital camera  1  i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6  or 5x7  prints and i wanted some really great 8x10  photos once in a while  2  i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was nt comfortable with that  i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily  3  i wanted a camera that had a lot of builtin settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although  i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings  4  and  of course  i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had nt used it much  depending on all the above requirements  i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models  nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes  medium compact size  price  brand name  good software that is included and previous reviews  i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since  picture the pictures are absolutely amazing  the camera captures the minutest of details  a few things that might make it even better  indoor picture11  pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay2u2  it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow  picture23  the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture  all the above  i think  are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints  try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems  whichever camera you buy  add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card  usb card reader  camera bag and the warranty  and finally  get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra  no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness  hope this review has helped you in making up your mind  i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience  i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now    manual mode  scene mode the possibilities with auto  manual  and the very helpful  scene  mode  which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait  landscape  beach  snow  sunset etc  are endless  movie mode the movie mode is also working great  software the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem  battery charger  usb and video cable  a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on  normal  resolution  print i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers  and they both delivered great results  print even at the  normal  setting  a 8x10 print  shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels  you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a  digital   battery life the battery life is ok  but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on  i therefore bought a second battery as a backup  and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger  which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe  we ran never out of  juice   i highly recommend the accessory kit  which provides you with everything else you need  a nice camera bag  which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger  furher it contains a card reader  a flash card folder for up to 8 cards  a lense cleaning rag  and an ac adapter  which is very helpful when working in an  outlet environment   camera over all a fantastic very compact camera  which made us experience photography on a totally new level   after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures  digital zoom optical zoom the digital zoom takes as good of pictures  as the optical zoom does  picture2the inside pics  can be a bit challenging  but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like  that are not focused perfectly  or need lighting adjustments  make this camera very simple and effective  feature i love all of the features  and presets as well  sunset feature sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning  and the evening  software the software you get with this camera is perfect  touchup  redeye touchups  redeye  and so on are very easy to alter  and correct  i definately recommend a large memory card  i use a 128mb card  and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 10241280 res  with good resolution  very large pics take 8mb each  battery life battery life is good  although i recommend two rechargebles  or a alkaline backup  for those emergency pics you have to have  camera all and all  i am extremely pleased with this camera  making the step from film to digital has been a great move  i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know  camera great camera  great investment   uquality size the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful  easy to use  high quality  and compact in size  with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation  auto setting the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them  if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300  i would order another just like it   pit has many great features and very few bad ones  picture ease of use it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use  if you read the manual  if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual  lcd1the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too  download downloads are a snap and quick  control controls easy yo use and easy to get to  camera i m extremely glad i bought this camera   really happy with this little camera  size uit is nt big and offensive  though you would nt know it by looking at the pics it takes  got it for christmas  still learning a few of the settings  but i do nt take pictures every single day  picture print settings for just about everything  beautiful pics and beautiful prints  zoomed image i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy  but onfull size high to fine quality  the zoomed images are quite impressive  did buy a 256mb compact flash  it holds a lot of pics at any resolution  i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions  but does nt seem any of the buget cameras do  camera still  at least from my perspective  a great camera for the money  and i m a happy camper   this is a wonderful camera  my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months  in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer s remorse  4mp optical zoom 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience  cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera  3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price  picture one neat thing  i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms  no problem

still  had to send it back to nikon for repair   nikon 4300  i feel  is the best camera out there for the features and price  here were my requirements in a digital camera  1  i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6  or 5x7  prints and i wanted some really great 8x10  photos once in a while  2  i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was nt comfortable with that  i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily  3  i wanted a camera that had a lot of builtin settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although  i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings  4  and  of course  i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had nt used it much  depending on all the above requirements  i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models  nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes  medium compact size  price  brand name  good software that is included and previous reviews  i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since  picture the pictures are absolutely amazing  the camera captures the minutest of details  a few things that might make it even better  indoor picture11  pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay2u2  it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow  picture23  the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture  all the above  i think  are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints  try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems  whichever camera you buy  add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card  usb card reader  camera bag and the warranty  and finally  get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra  no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness  hope this review has helped you in making up your mind  i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience  i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now    manual mode  scene mode the possibilities with auto  manual  and the very helpful  scene  mode  which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait  landscape  beach  snow  sunset etc  are endless  movie mode the movie mode is also working great  software the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem  battery charger  usb and video cable  a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on  normal  resolution  print i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers  and they both delivered great results  print even at the  normal  setting  a 8x10 print  shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels  you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a  digital   battery life the battery life is ok  but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on  i therefore bought a second battery as a backup  and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger  which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe  we ran never out of  juice   i highly recommend the accessory kit  which provides you with everything else you need  a nice camera bag  which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger  furher it contains a card reader  a flash card folder for up to 8 cards  a lense cleaning rag  and an ac adapter  which is very helpful when working in an  outlet environment   camera over all a fantastic very compact camera  which made us experience photography on a totally new level   after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures  digital zoom optical zoom the digital zoom takes as good of pictures  as the optical zoom does  picture2the inside pics  can be a bit challenging  but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like  that are not focused perfectly  or need lighting adjustments  make this camera very simple and effective  feature i love all of the features  and presets as well  sunset feature sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning  and the evening  software the software you get with this camera is perfect  touchup  redeye touchups  redeye  and so on are very easy to alter  and correct  i definately recommend a large memory card  i use a 128mb card  and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 10241280 res  with good resolution  very large pics take 8mb each  battery life battery life is good  although i recommend two rechargebles  or a alkaline backup  for those emergency pics you have to have  camera all and all  i am extremely pleased with this camera  making the step from film to digital has been a great move  i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know  camera great camera  great investment   uquality size the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful  easy to use  high quality  and compact in size  with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation  auto setting the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them  if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300  i would order another just like it   pit has many great features and very few bad ones  picture ease of use it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use  if you read the manual  if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual  lcd1the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too  download downloads are a snap and quick  control controls easy yo use and easy to get to  camera i m extremely glad i bought this camera   really happy with this little camera  size uit is nt big and offensive  though you would nt know it by looking at the pics it takes  got it for christmas  still learning a few of the settings  but i do nt take pictures every single day  picture print settings for just about everything  beautiful pics and beautiful prints  zoomed image i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy  but onfull size high to fine quality  the zoomed images are quite impressive  did buy a 256mb compact flash  it holds a lot of pics at any resolution  i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions  but does nt seem any of the buget cameras do  camera still  at least from my perspective  a great camera for the money  and i m a happy camper   this is a wonderful camera  my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months  in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer s remorse  4mp optical zoom 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience  cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera  3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price  picture one neat thing  i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms  no problem for the camera  rooms looked like they had ample lighting   this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much  software  online service the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95  of all photos taken by a beginner  100  perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos  i took the camera and just gave it to someone  no instructions  photo just point and shoot and the photos were great  just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos  memory card the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla  my pda becames a digital album  i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos  camera if you have to buy a camera on a buget this has got to be the one  go get it  before they are sold out   great camera  i have been using this for several months and got excellent results  simple friendly usage  in many scenes indoor  outdoor  snow  close up macro etc   feature this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has  use uit is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into  macro i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots  picture quality my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took  autofocus2one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low  i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life battery life is ok  i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it   great camera  and for the price you can t beat it  i ve been using it for about 3 months now  control i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly  quality the quality is superb  size the small size is perfect for my little hands  but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person   the 4300 is a very durable  compact package  and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust  it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade  we got a 256mb card  and have been hardpressed to fill it over a weekend  the only drawbacks that i have noticed  battery2it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long  especially if you use the flash a lot  so  it s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  autofocus assist light1it does not have an autofocus assist light which is nice for taking shots in lowlight situations it allows the camera to focus in low light  i would say that this is not a major issue  but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom1it has a 3x optical zoom  which is average for these cameras  for more  you sacrifice weight and size  more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length  it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom  but you sacrifice quality  i set the camera to the  manual  mode for one main reason  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries  in manual  you can set it to  single af  where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic  this is not really a hinderance  you just have to be familiar with its menus and features  in reality  these are the only drawbacks this camera has  much less than many other models  it is easy to  focus  in on the drawbacks  so do nt think i hate this camera  camera it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for generalto moderate snapping  for work  we use them in the field often  and they hold up really well  macro they take excellent macro shots as well  menu the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access  and it takes silent movies   i compared this to a lot of other cameras  believe me  it s value for money  picture the picturers are amazing  do nt waste time looking at anything else  just buy this one  it do nt get any better then the nikon 4300   function recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card  as expected  i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m4m pixel  fine combos and many of the userfriendly functions are very similar to slr models  and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately  txt file i particularly like the  txt  file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take size uthe compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them  try to buy a high capacity ultra card  as it s 2x as faster as the regular cf card  consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download  it s well worth the little extra money  an extra rechargeable enel 1 battery is also handy  so you will seldom run into  out of battery  situation  use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run  one thing puzzles me is that for  fine and 2200   quality pictures  one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130140 pics  but the size of the pictures are only around 12 mb  the math does not add up  i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 12 mbper  anybody can explain that  nikon a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories  as always   picture i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate  picture quality we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken  camera i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you downnow buy it   i have it for a week now  and this camera has exceeded my expectations  picture indoor shot the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away  the shutter lag is on par with what i ve experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me  and it was only a few dollars more  image download uuploading the images to my windowsbased pc is very fast and simple  indoor shot1the only drawbacks i ve encountered are  1 indoor shots from a distance  8ft lack contrast and color  but i ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with builtin flashes that i ve used even on a nikon slr  right now  i m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that s designed for digital cameras  battery life12 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations  i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died  an extra for a backup battery would be a good investment  software13 the picture editing software it came with is adequate  but not very robust  i ll still use my photosuite for editing  one more thing about indoor shots  many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing  just for the heck of it  i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door  and the focusing was just fine  camera in summary  i love this camera and would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range   since i wrote the review above in january 2003  i still love this camera  i ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful  i bought a digislave dsf1s flash unit  i do nt use a bracket  i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand  i also got a ure 4 step down ring adapter  lce 900 lens cap  and the nikon 28mm filter set  this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters  i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time  this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap  the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on  the camera wo nt fit in the small cases  and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find   great camera  use i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture it takes great pictures  manual the manual is easy to understand  and it is mostly idiot proof  size uit is small  unlike my canon slr  so it easily fits in my pocket  i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots  now where did i put that manual   i got this camera about a month ago and i can t put it down  i was considering buying the minolta f100 and the sony dscp 9  but at the camera shop  realized this one went above and beyond  picture quality i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time  autofocus scene mode manual mode autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all  i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card  buy this camera and savour it   pi have not been disappointed with my purchase  picture quality picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm  indoor shot2on average  indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm  however  the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures  camera i am extremely satisfied with this camera  i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion  buy an extra battery  life is good but still somewhat short  do nt buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card  you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution  i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera s controls are confusing and hard to remember  read the directions  the regular mode in this camera works for 80  of settings  scene mode the  scene  mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a  regular  setting  i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos  optical setting however  its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70  of the shots that i take  buy this camera  you wo nt regret it   if you re looking for a small  compact  super resolution digital camera  you can end your

have at hoome  nikon support 6 the nikon coolpix line is a wellestablished line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model  picture quality 7 picture quality is excellent  battery life 8 battery life is excellent  optical zoom 9 3x builtin optical zoom is a lot for this price range  price 10 great price for all the features  here s what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera  firewire11 no direct firewire to the camera  there is usb  though  viewfinder12 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wideangle  wce 68  the optical viewfinder is partially obscured  this does nt affect the picture  of course  you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture  it s no problem for me personally  3 battery has to be removed to recharge  4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery s out is not included  although one can be purchased separately  5 two different adapters

becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow  picture23  the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture  all the above  i think  are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints  try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems  whichever camera you buy  add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card  usb card reader  camera bag and the warranty  and finally  get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra  no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness  hope this review has helped you in making up your mind  i have taken about 150 photographs so far and

them  if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300  i would order another just like it   pit has many great features and very few bad ones  picture ease of use it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use  if you read the manual  if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual  lcd1the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is

happy with this little camera  size uit is nt big and offensive  though you would nt know it by looking at the pics it takes  got it for christmas  still learning a few of the settings  but i do nt take pictures every single day  picture print settings for just about everything  beautiful pics and beautiful prints  zoomed image i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy  but onfull size high to fine quality  the zoomed images are quite impressive  did buy a 256mb compact flash  it holds a lot of pics at any resolution  i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions  but does nt seem any of the buget cameras do  camera still  at least from my perspective  a great camera for the money  and i m a happy camper   this is a wonderful camera  my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months  in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer s remorse  4mp optical zoom 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience  cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera  3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price  picture one neat thing  i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms  no problem for the camera  rooms looked like they had ample lighting   this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much  software  online service the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95  of all photos taken by a beginner  100  perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos  i took the camera and just gave it to someone  no instructions  photo just point and shoot and the photos were great  just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos  memory card the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla  my pda becames a digital album  i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos  camera if you have to buy a camera on a buget this has got to be the one  go get it  before they are sold out   great camera  i have been using this for several months and got excellent results  simple friendly usage  in many scenes indoor  outdoor  snow  close up macro etc   feature this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has  use uit is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into  macro i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots  picture quality my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took  autofocus2one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low  i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life battery life is ok  i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it   great camera  and for the price you can t beat it  i ve been using it for about 3 months now  control i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly  quality the quality is superb  size the small size is perfect for my little hands  but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person   the 4300 is a very durable  compact package  and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust  it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade  we got a 256mb card  and have been hardpressed to fill it over a weekend  the only drawbacks that i have noticed  battery2it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long  especially if you use the flash a lot  so  it s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  autofocus assist light1it does not have an autofocus assist light which is nice for taking shots in lowlight situations it allows the camera to focus in low light  i would say that this is not a major issue  but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom1it has a 3x optical zoom  which is average for these cameras  for more  you sacrifice weight and size  more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length  it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom  but you sacrifice quality  i set the camera to the  manual  mode for one main reason  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries  in manual  you can set it to  single af  where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic  this is not really a hinderance  you just have to be familiar with its menus and features  in reality  these are the only drawbacks this camera has  much less than many other models  it is easy to  focus  in on the drawbacks  so do nt think i hate this camera  camera it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for generalto moderate snapping  for work  we use them in the field often  and they hold up really well  macro they take excellent macro shots as well  menu the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access  and it takes silent movies   i compared this to a lot of other cameras  believe me  it s value for money  picture the picturers are amazing  do nt waste time looking at anything else  just buy this one  it do nt get any better then the nikon 4300   function recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card  as expected  i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m4m pixel  fine combos and many of the userfriendly functions are very similar to slr models  and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately  txt file i particularly like the  txt  file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take size uthe compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them  try to buy a high capacity ultra card  as it s 2x as faster as the regular cf card  consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download  it s well worth the little extra money  an extra rechargeable enel 1 battery is also handy  so you will seldom run into  out of battery  situation  use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run  one thing puzzles me is that for  fine and 2200   quality pictures  one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130140 pics  but the size of the pictures are only around 12 mb  the math does not add up  i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 12 mbper  anybody can explain that  nikon a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories  as always   picture i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate  picture quality we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken  camera i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you downnow buy it   i have it for a week now  and this camera has exceeded my expectations  picture indoor shot the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away  the shutter lag is on par with what i ve experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me  and it was only a few dollars more  image download uuploading the images to my windowsbased pc is very fast and simple  indoor shot1the only drawbacks i ve encountered are  1 indoor shots from a distance  8ft lack contrast and color  but i ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with builtin flashes that i ve used even on a nikon slr  right now  i m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that s designed for digital cameras  battery life12 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations  i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died  an extra for a backup battery would be a good investment  software13 the picture editing software it came with is adequate  but not very robust  i ll still use my photosuite for editing  one more thing about indoor shots  many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing  just for the heck of it  i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door  and the focusing was just fine  camera in summary  i love this camera and would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range   since i wrote the review above in january 2003  i still love this camera  i ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful  i bought a digislave dsf1s flash unit  i do nt use a bracket  i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand  i also got a ure 4 step down ring adapter  lce 900 lens cap  and the nikon 28mm filter set  this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters  i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time  this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap  the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on  the camera wo nt fit in the small cases  and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find   great camera  use i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture it takes great pictures  manual the manual is easy to understand  and it is mostly idiot proof  size uit is small  unlike my canon slr  so it easily fits in my pocket  i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots  now where did i put that manual   i got this camera about a month ago and i can t put it down  i was considering buying the minolta f100 and the sony dscp 9  but at the camera shop  realized this one went above and beyond  picture quality i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time  autofocus scene mode manual mode autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all  i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card  buy this camera and savour it   pi have not been disappointed with my purchase  picture quality picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm  indoor shot2on average  indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm  however  the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures  camera i am extremely satisfied with this camera  i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion  buy an extra battery  life is good but still somewhat short  do nt buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card  you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution  i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera s controls are confusing and hard to remember  read the directions  the regular mode in this camera works for 80  of settings  scene mode the  scene  mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a  regular  setting  i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos  optical setting however  its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70  of the shots that i take  buy this camera  you wo nt regret it   if you re looking for a small  compact  super resolution digital camera  you can end your search with the nikon 4300  picture quality after a lengthy and extensive journey for a featureloaded  high performance  travel size camera  i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel  nikon after using it for about a month  i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck  use  accessory its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wideangle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake  picture quality feature yes  the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range  design construction optic the design and construction are excellent  as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics  i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital  if you re seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer s remorse and filled with cool  then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300   there are so many functions in this little  yet powerful camera   pseriously  i love it  my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera  they came out black  but with this  they look the same in the picture as in real life  better actually cause my carpet looks clean  lol  camera but this camera is great  picture quality movie the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to  i can t connect it to my computer though  but that s a problem with windows me  not the camera  if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway  lol  but it works perfectly fine on my parent s computer  lense cap it does have a lense cap  but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good  battery the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice  camera ooh  and i dropped it and it still works fine  this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet   feature  camera it s easy for beginners to use  but has features that more serious photographers will love  so it s an excellent camera to grow into  weight  picture uit s light weight enough to take with you everywhere  but powerful enough to get outstanding pix  continuous shot mode i love the continuous shot mode  which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession  great for action shots  photo quality print i m amazed at the photo quality  prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints  8mb card2i only have one complaint  and that is the 8mb card included  8mb28mb for a camera like this is a joke  a card with more memory is a must  a minor quibble  since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards   1 it has all the features an amatuer photoenthusiast would want  use 2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use  size ucontrol 3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they re still easy to use  4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms  5 for  digital film  it uses compact flash cards  which are easy to find  cheap  reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome  nikon support 6 the nikon coolpix line is a wellestablished line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model  picture quality 7 picture quality is excellent  battery life 8 battery life is excellent  optical zoom 9 3x builtin optical zoom is a lot for this price range  price 10 great price for all the features  here s what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera  firewire11 no direct firewire to the camera  there is usb  though  viewfinder12 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wideangle  wce 68  the optical viewfinder is partially obscured  this does nt affect the picture  of course  you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture  it s no problem for me personally  3 battery has to be removed to recharge  4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery s out is not included  although one can be purchased separately  5 two different adapters  ure 4 and ure 7  are required for some attachment lenses  most of these  annoyances   though  are comparable to what you ll find on other cameras in this price range   ulearn image this camera was affordable  very easy to learn  and produces spectacular images  auto mode scene mode manual mode the automode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have nt played with it too much on manual  size it s size also makes it ideal for travel  camera overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable  robust  and useful little camera   ","negative":""}
{"id":34,"title":"nikon does it again camera","positive":"this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer  picture  macro the pictures are razorsharp  even in macro  size uit is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse  weight uit is light enough to carry around all day without bother  feature uoperating its many features is easy and often obvious  i m no annie lebovitz  but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store  manual the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain  auto focus scene mode the autofocus performs well  but i love having the 12 optional scene modes  they are dummyproof  and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera  rechargable battery comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit  included  is fast and small  i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery  so it s good to go on a long vacation  camera i enthusiastically recommend this camera   p use u feature it s easy to use  and yet very feature rich  auto mode scene mode in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click  the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results  manual mode the manual mode is feature rich and i can t wait to get the hang of it  macro mode picture the macro mode is exceptional  the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject  battery life the battery life is very good  i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time  the first time around  and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then  and have yet needed to recharge it  the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card  which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution  i intend to buy a bigger card soon    use i fell in love with this camera  it combines ease of use  with an immense amount of options and power  you can use the scene modes  or fine tune the options  i you can change the iso level  shutter speed  etc camera this camera is ideal for people who want more power  but do nt want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera   with nikon  although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras  i ve had the following headaches  transfer21  pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable  i did everything i could  and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader  card reader is included  2  the speed is noticeably slower than canon  especially so with flashes on  3  with low battery  it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip  i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar  be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries    picture  closeup shooting but overall this is a good camera with a  really good  picture clarity  an exceptional closeup shooting capability  i would rate this is 45 stars picture quality  image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix   customer service2it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality  but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service   delay otherwise  it takes very good pictures  shutter delay is nt so bad either  still  had to send it back to nikon for repair   nikon 4300  i feel  is the best camera out there for the features and price  here were my requirements in a digital camera  1  i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6  or 5x7  prints and i wanted some really great 8x10  photos once in a while  2  i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was nt comfortable with that  i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily  3  i wanted a camera that had a lot of builtin settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although  i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings  4  and  of course  i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had nt used it much  depending on all the above requirements  i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models  nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes  medium compact size  price  brand name  good software that is included and previous reviews  i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since  picture the pictures are absolutely amazing  the camera captures the minutest of details  a few things

control i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly  quality the quality is superb  size the small size is perfect for my little hands  but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person   the 4300 is a very durable  compact package  and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust  it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade  we got a 256mb card  and have been hardpressed to fill it over a weekend  the only drawbacks that i have noticed  battery2it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long  especially if you use the flash a lot  so  it s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  autofocus assist light1it does not have an autofocus assist light which is nice for taking shots in lowlight situations it allows the camera to focus in low light  i would say that this is not a major issue  but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom1it has a 3x optical zoom  which is average for these cameras  for more  you sacrifice weight and size  more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length  it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom  but you sacrifice quality  i set the camera to the  manual  mode for one main reason  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries  in manual  you can set it to  single af  where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic  this is not really a hinderance  you just have to be familiar with its menus and features  in reality  these are the only drawbacks this camera has  much less than many other models  it is easy to  focus  in on the drawbacks  so do nt think i hate this camera  camera it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for generalto moderate snapping  for work  we use them in the field often  and they hold up really well  macro they take excellent macro shots as well  menu the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access  and it takes silent movies   i compared this to a lot of other cameras  believe me  it s value for money  picture the picturers are amazing  do nt waste time looking at anything else  just buy this one  it do nt get any better then the nikon 4300   function recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card  as expected  i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m4m pixel  fine combos and many of the userfriendly functions are very similar to slr models  and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately  txt file i particularly like the  txt  file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take size uthe compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them  try to buy a high capacity ultra card  as it s 2x as faster as the regular cf card  consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download  it s well worth the little extra money  an extra rechargeable enel 1 battery is also handy  so you will seldom run into  out of battery  situation  use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run  one thing puzzles me is that for  fine and 2200   quality pictures  one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130140 pics  but the size of the pictures are only around 12 mb  the math does not add up  i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 12 mbper  anybody can explain that  nikon a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories  as always   picture i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does nt take weeks to figure out how to operate  picture quality we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken  camera i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you downnow buy it   i have it for a week now  and this camera has exceeded my expectations  picture indoor shot the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away  the shutter lag is on par with what i ve experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me  and it was only a few dollars more  image download uuploading the images to my windowsbased pc is very fast and simple  indoor shot1the only drawbacks i ve encountered are  1 indoor shots from a distance  8ft lack contrast and color  but i ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with builtin flashes that i ve used even on a nikon slr  right now  i m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that s designed for digital cameras  battery life12 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations  i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died  an extra for a backup battery would be a good investment  software13 the picture editing software it came with is adequate  but not very robust  i ll still use my photosuite for editing  one more thing about indoor shots  many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing  just for the heck of it  i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door  and the focusing was just fine  camera in summary  i love this camera and would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range   since i wrote the review above in january 2003  i still love this camera  i ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful  i bought a digislave dsf1s flash unit  i do nt use a bracket  i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand  i also got a ure 4 step down ring adapter  lce 900 lens cap  and the nikon 28mm filter set  this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters  i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time  this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap  the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on  the camera wo nt fit in the small cases  and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find   great camera  use i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture it takes great pictures  manual the manual is easy to understand  and it is mostly idiot proof  size uit is small  unlike my canon slr  so it easily fits in my pocket  i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots  now where did i put that manual   i got this camera about a month ago and i can t put it down  i was considering buying the minolta f100 and the sony dscp 9  but at the camera shop  realized this one went above and beyond  picture quality i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time  autofocus scene mode manual mode autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all  i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card  buy this camera and savour it   pi have not been disappointed with my purchase  picture quality picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm  indoor shot2on average  indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm  however  the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures  camera i am extremely satisfied with this camera  i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion  buy an extra battery  life is good but still somewhat short  do nt buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card  you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution  i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera s controls are confusing and hard to remember  read the directions  the regular mode in this camera works for 80  of settings  scene mode the  scene  mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a  regular  setting  i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos  optical setting however  its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70  of the shots that i take  buy this camera  you wo nt regret it   if you re looking for a small  compact  super resolution digital camera  you can end your search with the nikon 4300  picture quality after a lengthy and extensive journey for a featureloaded  high performance  travel size camera  i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel  nikon after using it for about a month  i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck  use  accessory its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wideangle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake  picture quality feature yes  the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range  design construction optic the design and construction are excellent  as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics  i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital  if you re seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer s remorse and filled with cool  then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300   there are so many functions in this little  yet powerful camera   pseriously  i love it  my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera  they came out black  but with this  they look the same in the picture as in real life  better actually cause my carpet looks clean  lol  camera but this camera is great  picture quality movie the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to  i can t connect it to my computer though  but that s a problem with windows me  not the camera  if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway  lol  but it works perfectly fine on my parent s computer  lense cap it does have a lense cap  but it wo nt let you take pics with it on which is real good  battery the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice  camera ooh  and i dropped it and it still works fine  this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet   feature  camera it s easy for beginners to use  but has features that more serious photographers will love  so it s an excellent camera to grow into  weight  picture uit s light weight enough to take with you everywhere  but powerful enough to get outstanding pix  continuous shot mode i love the continuous shot mode  which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession  great for action shots  photo quality print i m amazed at the photo quality  prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints  8mb card2i only have one complaint  and that is the 8mb card included  8mb28mb for a camera like this is a joke  a card with more memory is a must  a minor quibble  since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards   1 it has all the features an amatuer photoenthusiast would want  use 2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use  size ucontrol 3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they re still easy to use  4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms  5 for  digital film  it uses compact flash cards  which are easy to find  cheap  reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome  nikon support 6 the nikon coolpix line is a wellestablished line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model  picture quality 7 picture quality is excellent  battery life 8 battery life is excellent  optical zoom 9 3x builtin optical zoom is a lot for this price range  price 10 great price for all the features  here s what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera  firewire11 no direct firewire to the camera  there is usb  though  viewfinder12 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wideangle  wce 68  the optical viewfinder is partially obscured  this does nt affect the picture  of course  you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture  it s no problem for me personally  3 battery has to be removed to recharge  4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery s out is not included  although one can be purchased separately  5 two different adapters  ure 4 and ure 7  are required for some attachment lenses  most of these  annoyances   though  are comparable to what you ll find on other cameras in this price range   ulearn image this camera was affordable  very easy to learn  and produces spectacular images  auto mode scene mode manual mode the automode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have nt played with it too much on manual  size it s size also makes it ideal for travel  camera overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable  robust  and useful little camera    print quality awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package  closeup mode  battery the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera  plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders  great closeup mode  long lasting rechargable battery  etc etc camera in my opinion it s the best camera for the money if you re looking for something that s easy to use  small good for travel  and provides excellent  sharp images   ","negative":""}
