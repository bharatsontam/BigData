northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size

warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive

on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly

feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it

{"id":18,"title":"slightly better than average phone in its class  first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year  right after the release contract is over   my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone  below is how i evaulate this phone with other tmobile phones which i have borrowed from parents  friends  sound quality  the most important thing for me is sound quality  sound quality","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions

is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   ","negative":""}

right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are

 of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a

such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to

the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile

sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but

radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   ","negative":""}

in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone

the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if

think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes

{"id":24,"title":"i really think  i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it  ","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so

infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    ","negative":""}

good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed   ","negative":""}
{"id":27,"title":"nokia 6610  sound quality  the phone is great with very cool features 38 options  but comparing to my older motorola phone  it gets a failing grade in speaker quality  sound2volume2i do here a constant highpitched distorted sound  not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough  it s going back today  38 being replaced with the new samsung x105  you do take your chances with this phone  ","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size

i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice

it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of

the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and

used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime

volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   ","negative":""}
{"id":30,"title":"awesome phone  great prices on amazoncom  i could nt be happier with tmobile either  i switched from cingular  screen2one complaint  the screen is too easily scratched  but there are faceplates to replace it i guess  almost there  i got this phone in tmobile s current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal  i was getting so sick of my old motorola

of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a

no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   radio signal speakerphone application it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps  what it lacks for me is nt available on one phone yet  namely gsm850  also sometimes known as gsm800   bluetooth and edge  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again  but for now this will do  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the triband gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  phone great phone   feature great features

{"id":31,"title":"great plan  i purchased this phone after having been an at 38 t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years  size","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive

jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   radio signal speakerphone application it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps  what it lacks for me is nt available on one phone yet  namely gsm850  also sometimes known as gsm800   bluetooth and edge  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again  but for now this will do  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the triband gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  phone great phone   feature great features    speakerphone plan i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email  i went to an at 38 t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads  they told me i would have to connect to my laptop  which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email  with the tmobile unlimited tzones for  10  i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet  phone i have had no problems with the phone  friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it  i ve even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive  phone great phone  i d buy another   ","negative":""}
{"id":32,"title":"excellent phone  phone","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has

equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   radio signal speakerphone application it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps  what it lacks for me is nt available on one phone yet  namely gsm850  also sometimes known as gsm800   bluetooth and edge  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again  but for now this will do  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the triband gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  phone great phone   feature great features    speakerphone plan i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email  i went to an at 38 t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads  they told me i would have to connect to my laptop  which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email  with the tmobile unlimited tzones for  10  i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet  phone i have had no problems with the phone  friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it  i ve even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive  phone great phone  i d buy another    look excellent phone  the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures  bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better  default ringtone3one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone overall an excellent phone  tmobile the service from tmobile is very good too  in all a winning combination  worth every penny  phone use network great phone  easy to use  excellent network  no regrets     ","negative":""}
{"id":33,"title":"yo what a find  phone","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   radio signal speakerphone application it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps  what it lacks for me is nt available on one phone yet  namely gsm850  also sometimes known as gsm800   bluetooth and edge  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again  but for now this will do  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the triband gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  phone great phone   feature great features    speakerphone plan i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email  i went to an at 38 t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads  they told me i would have to connect to my laptop  which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email  with the tmobile unlimited tzones for  10  i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet  phone i have had no problems with the phone  friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it  i ve even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive  phone great phone  i d buy another    look excellent phone  the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures  bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better  default ringtone3one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone overall an excellent phone  tmobile the service from tmobile is very good too  in all a winning combination  worth every penny  phone use network great phone  easy to use  excellent network  no regrets     i purchased this phone for just 50  and there is no end to what i can do with it  phone nokia and tmobile really teamed up well on this baby  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet  without a bulky phone like the treo or something  which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it  now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school  people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant  service ringtone service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from tmobile and aim is great  now i can always be in contact  phone this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range  or like me  do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones  a great deal in general  i would not give up this phone for the world  phone 1 month  no problems  great phone i m very pleased with my 6610 phone  feature yes  the features are numerous  speakerphone the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had  people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i m even using a speakerphone  sound quality the sound quality is excellent  except  maybe a  tad  too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line  earpiece the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use  phone i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before  nokia has definitely won me over with this one   ","negative":""}
{"id":34,"title":"best phone out there  a not only is this the best phone out there but is cheap  free     size","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   radio signal speakerphone application it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps  what it lacks for me is nt available on one phone yet  namely gsm850  also sometimes known as gsm800   bluetooth and edge  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again  but for now this will do  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the triband gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  phone great phone   feature great features    speakerphone plan i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email  i went to an at 38 t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads  they told me i would have to connect to my laptop  which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email  with the tmobile unlimited tzones for  10  i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet  phone i have had no problems with the phone  friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it  i ve even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive  phone great phone  i d buy another    look excellent phone  the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures  bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better  default ringtone3one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone overall an excellent phone  tmobile the service from tmobile is very good too  in all a winning combination  worth every penny  phone use network great phone  easy to use  excellent network  no regrets     i purchased this phone for just 50  and there is no end to what i can do with it  phone nokia and tmobile really teamed up well on this baby  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet  without a bulky phone like the treo or something  which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it  now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school  people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant  service ringtone service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from tmobile and aim is great  now i can always be in contact  phone this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range  or like me  do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones  a great deal in general  i would not give up this phone for the world  phone 1 month  no problems  great phone i m very pleased with my 6610 phone  feature yes  the features are numerous  speakerphone the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had  people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i m even using a speakerphone  sound quality the sound quality is excellent  except  maybe a  tad  too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line  earpiece the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use  phone i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before  nokia has definitely won me over with this one   u look1first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better  radio the radio feature has superb sound quality  i ve compared this phone to others such as 6100  siemens sl55  even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them  design it has a classic design yet looks hip  is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel  weight uit is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket  for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style  battery the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there  one thing that i found out recently is that you do nt need tzones from tmobile to go online  every tmobile plan comes with gsm data  meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps  with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference   anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net  being able to download pics and ringtones  not java apps  you need tzones for that   tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans  if you thought about getting this phone buy it  phone this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities   ","negative":""}
{"id":35,"title":"6610  great phone and a few extras i am a person that needs my phone  s  on demand  i currrently have service with tmobile  verizon  and tmobile  the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering  that beside you are prob very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for  and one that has not yet been mentioned  using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 10 port  using the gprs option you can pay 1999 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account  yes it is 56k speed  but the functionality is what you are paying for  i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable  4999  nokiausacom or tmobilecom  press dial up on my laptop  by the way it is a mac pb 1gz and in a matter of seconds i can access my email  fax  and the entire web from my truck  internet1the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls  real estate broker software  very well at all  i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the tmobile  hotspots   browsing","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   radio signal speakerphone application it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps  what it lacks for me is nt available on one phone yet  namely gsm850  also sometimes known as gsm800   bluetooth and edge  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again  but for now this will do  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the triband gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  phone great phone   feature great features    speakerphone plan i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email  i went to an at 38 t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads  they told me i would have to connect to my laptop  which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email  with the tmobile unlimited tzones for  10  i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet  phone i have had no problems with the phone  friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it  i ve even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive  phone great phone  i d buy another    look excellent phone  the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures  bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better  default ringtone3one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone overall an excellent phone  tmobile the service from tmobile is very good too  in all a winning combination  worth every penny  phone use network great phone  easy to use  excellent network  no regrets     i purchased this phone for just 50  and there is no end to what i can do with it  phone nokia and tmobile really teamed up well on this baby  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet  without a bulky phone like the treo or something  which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it  now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school  people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant  service ringtone service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from tmobile and aim is great  now i can always be in contact  phone this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range  or like me  do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones  a great deal in general  i would not give up this phone for the world  phone 1 month  no problems  great phone i m very pleased with my 6610 phone  feature yes  the features are numerous  speakerphone the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had  people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i m even using a speakerphone  sound quality the sound quality is excellent  except  maybe a  tad  too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line  earpiece the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use  phone i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before  nokia has definitely won me over with this one   u look1first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better  radio the radio feature has superb sound quality  i ve compared this phone to others such as 6100  siemens sl55  even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them  design it has a classic design yet looks hip  is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel  weight uit is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket  for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style  battery the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there  one thing that i found out recently is that you do nt need tzones from tmobile to go online  every tmobile plan comes with gsm data  meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps  with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference   anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net  being able to download pics and ringtones  not java apps  you need tzones for that   tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans  if you thought about getting this phone buy it  phone this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities   it does well in all aspects of internet browsing  as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it   ","negative":""}
{"id":36,"title":"sound good but complicated  do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate  also  if i want a family plan  which mean i need tw phones on a plan   so how can i do that  are nt that free for two after the rebates  and how can i do that   print those coupons twice for two phones   ","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   radio signal speakerphone application it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps  what it lacks for me is nt available on one phone yet  namely gsm850  also sometimes known as gsm800   bluetooth and edge  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again  but for now this will do  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the triband gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  phone great phone   feature great features    speakerphone plan i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email  i went to an at 38 t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads  they told me i would have to connect to my laptop  which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email  with the tmobile unlimited tzones for  10  i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet  phone i have had no problems with the phone  friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it  i ve even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive  phone great phone  i d buy another    look excellent phone  the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures  bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better  default ringtone3one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone overall an excellent phone  tmobile the service from tmobile is very good too  in all a winning combination  worth every penny  phone use network great phone  easy to use  excellent network  no regrets     i purchased this phone for just 50  and there is no end to what i can do with it  phone nokia and tmobile really teamed up well on this baby  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet  without a bulky phone like the treo or something  which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it  now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school  people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant  service ringtone service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from tmobile and aim is great  now i can always be in contact  phone this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range  or like me  do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones  a great deal in general  i would not give up this phone for the world  phone 1 month  no problems  great phone i m very pleased with my 6610 phone  feature yes  the features are numerous  speakerphone the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had  people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i m even using a speakerphone  sound quality the sound quality is excellent  except  maybe a  tad  too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line  earpiece the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use  phone i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before  nokia has definitely won me over with this one   u look1first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better  radio the radio feature has superb sound quality  i ve compared this phone to others such as 6100  siemens sl55  even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them  design it has a classic design yet looks hip  is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel  weight uit is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket  for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style  battery the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there  one thing that i found out recently is that you do nt need tzones from tmobile to go online  every tmobile plan comes with gsm data  meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps  with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference   anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net  being able to download pics and ringtones  not java apps  you need tzones for that   tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans  if you thought about getting this phone buy it  phone this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities   it does well in all aspects of internet browsing  as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it   ","negative":""}
{"id":37,"title":"do nt have the phone just commenting  i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing  the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon  tmobile and nokia  the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone  my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset  game2i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing  i do nt really like bounce  i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones  battery life","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   radio signal speakerphone application it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps  what it lacks for me is nt available on one phone yet  namely gsm850  also sometimes known as gsm800   bluetooth and edge  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again  but for now this will do  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the triband gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  phone great phone   feature great features    speakerphone plan i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email  i went to an at 38 t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads  they told me i would have to connect to my laptop  which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email  with the tmobile unlimited tzones for  10  i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet  phone i have had no problems with the phone  friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it  i ve even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive  phone great phone  i d buy another    look excellent phone  the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures  bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better  default ringtone3one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone overall an excellent phone  tmobile the service from tmobile is very good too  in all a winning combination  worth every penny  phone use network great phone  easy to use  excellent network  no regrets     i purchased this phone for just 50  and there is no end to what i can do with it  phone nokia and tmobile really teamed up well on this baby  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet  without a bulky phone like the treo or something  which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it  now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school  people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant  service ringtone service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from tmobile and aim is great  now i can always be in contact  phone this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range  or like me  do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones  a great deal in general  i would not give up this phone for the world  phone 1 month  no problems  great phone i m very pleased with my 6610 phone  feature yes  the features are numerous  speakerphone the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had  people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i m even using a speakerphone  sound quality the sound quality is excellent  except  maybe a  tad  too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line  earpiece the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use  phone i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before  nokia has definitely won me over with this one   u look1first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better  radio the radio feature has superb sound quality  i ve compared this phone to others such as 6100  siemens sl55  even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them  design it has a classic design yet looks hip  is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel  weight uit is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket  for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style  battery the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there  one thing that i found out recently is that you do nt need tzones from tmobile to go online  every tmobile plan comes with gsm data  meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps  with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference   anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net  being able to download pics and ringtones  not java apps  you need tzones for that   tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans  if you thought about getting this phone buy it  phone this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities   it does well in all aspects of internet browsing  as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it   battery life is good for a phone of this size  voice dialing but anyway  the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing  screen sound great screen and great sound  ok  everybody loves the fm radio in this  but you want a cell phone first  right  phone the 6610 excels as a cell phone  thank god  voice quality reception the voice quality is very good  and it gets great reception  that is  in places where you get tmobile coverage  which is not that good  see below   screen command the color screen makes this freeafterrebates phone shine bright  and commands are very responsive  button2my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons  nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad  which imho is totally unnecessary  key2this model does have the traditional key arrangement  it s just that they are really close to one another  and have unconventional shapes  so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands   to be fair  the same can be said about many korean imports  and the nokia s build quality is light years ahead of the koreans   phone other than that  this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips  tmobile2finally  i reiterate my thumbsdown rating for tmobile as a carrier  tmobile2their network coverage is very sporadic  and the network always seems overloaded  resulting in very unpleasant calling experience  if you can get this phone for cingular or att  go with the other carriers   ","negative":""}
{"id":38,"title":"great phone  great service  no voice dialing  phone","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   radio signal speakerphone application it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps  what it lacks for me is nt available on one phone yet  namely gsm850  also sometimes known as gsm800   bluetooth and edge  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again  but for now this will do  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the triband gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  phone great phone   feature great features    speakerphone plan i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email  i went to an at 38 t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads  they told me i would have to connect to my laptop  which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email  with the tmobile unlimited tzones for  10  i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet  phone i have had no problems with the phone  friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it  i ve even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive  phone great phone  i d buy another    look excellent phone  the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures  bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better  default ringtone3one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone overall an excellent phone  tmobile the service from tmobile is very good too  in all a winning combination  worth every penny  phone use network great phone  easy to use  excellent network  no regrets     i purchased this phone for just 50  and there is no end to what i can do with it  phone nokia and tmobile really teamed up well on this baby  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet  without a bulky phone like the treo or something  which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it  now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school  people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant  service ringtone service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from tmobile and aim is great  now i can always be in contact  phone this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range  or like me  do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones  a great deal in general  i would not give up this phone for the world  phone 1 month  no problems  great phone i m very pleased with my 6610 phone  feature yes  the features are numerous  speakerphone the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had  people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i m even using a speakerphone  sound quality the sound quality is excellent  except  maybe a  tad  too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line  earpiece the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use  phone i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before  nokia has definitely won me over with this one   u look1first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better  radio the radio feature has superb sound quality  i ve compared this phone to others such as 6100  siemens sl55  even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them  design it has a classic design yet looks hip  is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel  weight uit is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket  for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style  battery the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there  one thing that i found out recently is that you do nt need tzones from tmobile to go online  every tmobile plan comes with gsm data  meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps  with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference   anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net  being able to download pics and ringtones  not java apps  you need tzones for that   tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans  if you thought about getting this phone buy it  phone this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities   it does well in all aspects of internet browsing  as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it   battery life is good for a phone of this size  voice dialing but anyway  the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing  screen sound great screen and great sound  ok  everybody loves the fm radio in this  but you want a cell phone first  right  phone the 6610 excels as a cell phone  thank god  voice quality reception the voice quality is very good  and it gets great reception  that is  in places where you get tmobile coverage  which is not that good  see below   screen command the color screen makes this freeafterrebates phone shine bright  and commands are very responsive  button2my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons  nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad  which imho is totally unnecessary  key2this model does have the traditional key arrangement  it s just that they are really close to one another  and have unconventional shapes  so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands   to be fair  the same can be said about many korean imports  and the nokia s build quality is light years ahead of the koreans   phone other than that  this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips  tmobile2finally  i reiterate my thumbsdown rating for tmobile as a carrier  tmobile2their network coverage is very sporadic  and the network always seems overloaded  resulting in very unpleasant calling experience  if you can get this phone for cingular or att  go with the other carriers   the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone  and what a great phone it is  when i first saw the 6610  i thought it was too small  size after using it  i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket  earpiece it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder  but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree earpiece which is included  the earpiece has a button that answers and hangsup the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all  unless dialing a number  voice dialing2unfortunately  the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone  but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming  screen when i turned the phone on  the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is  resolution  color the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable  the phone has several color schemes you can choose from  i like the default blue  you can also set a background wallpaper  ringtone the ringtones included are awesome  and did i mention they were polyphonic  no more annoying series of beeps  this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music  ring you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call  the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries  with multiple phone number per entry  so you can program your boss s home  work and cellphone numbers all under one contact  phone the phone also sports an image gallery  with option camera attachment   a calendar  organizer  alarm clock with snooze  fm radio  way cool  even if it is just through an earpeice   games  java applications and gprs highspeed internet connection  gprs1tzone the gprs connection is sometimes slow  and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain  but the other tzones applications are quite useful  you can get weather  movies  horoscopes and more with a few clicks  the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code  but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go  tzone2one downside  as of this writing  tmobile has nt updated their tzone system to fully support the 6610  their website does not show it as a compatible phone  and should i try to access the game downloads on tzones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported  i have been assured this will be fixed soon  now  for the tmobile service  i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones  if you have a question  they have the answer  and should they not know it  they can find it out pretty quick  every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone  tmobile service uall my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved  i d like to see my old carrier do that  rate plan the rate plans are also very good  at least for me  different people have different needs  of course  but the tmobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive  the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from tzones worked  phone this phone is highly recommended otherwise   ","negative":""}
{"id":39,"title":"tmobile ruins an otherwise good phone  phone","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   radio signal speakerphone application it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps  what it lacks for me is nt available on one phone yet  namely gsm850  also sometimes known as gsm800   bluetooth and edge  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again  but for now this will do  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the triband gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  phone great phone   feature great features    speakerphone plan i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email  i went to an at 38 t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads  they told me i would have to connect to my laptop  which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email  with the tmobile unlimited tzones for  10  i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet  phone i have had no problems with the phone  friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it  i ve even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive  phone great phone  i d buy another    look excellent phone  the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures  bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better  default ringtone3one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone overall an excellent phone  tmobile the service from tmobile is very good too  in all a winning combination  worth every penny  phone use network great phone  easy to use  excellent network  no regrets     i purchased this phone for just 50  and there is no end to what i can do with it  phone nokia and tmobile really teamed up well on this baby  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet  without a bulky phone like the treo or something  which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it  now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school  people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant  service ringtone service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from tmobile and aim is great  now i can always be in contact  phone this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range  or like me  do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones  a great deal in general  i would not give up this phone for the world  phone 1 month  no problems  great phone i m very pleased with my 6610 phone  feature yes  the features are numerous  speakerphone the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had  people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i m even using a speakerphone  sound quality the sound quality is excellent  except  maybe a  tad  too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line  earpiece the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use  phone i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before  nokia has definitely won me over with this one   u look1first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better  radio the radio feature has superb sound quality  i ve compared this phone to others such as 6100  siemens sl55  even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them  design it has a classic design yet looks hip  is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel  weight uit is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket  for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style  battery the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there  one thing that i found out recently is that you do nt need tzones from tmobile to go online  every tmobile plan comes with gsm data  meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps  with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference   anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net  being able to download pics and ringtones  not java apps  you need tzones for that   tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans  if you thought about getting this phone buy it  phone this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities   it does well in all aspects of internet browsing  as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it   battery life is good for a phone of this size  voice dialing but anyway  the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing  screen sound great screen and great sound  ok  everybody loves the fm radio in this  but you want a cell phone first  right  phone the 6610 excels as a cell phone  thank god  voice quality reception the voice quality is very good  and it gets great reception  that is  in places where you get tmobile coverage  which is not that good  see below   screen command the color screen makes this freeafterrebates phone shine bright  and commands are very responsive  button2my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons  nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad  which imho is totally unnecessary  key2this model does have the traditional key arrangement  it s just that they are really close to one another  and have unconventional shapes  so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands   to be fair  the same can be said about many korean imports  and the nokia s build quality is light years ahead of the koreans   phone other than that  this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips  tmobile2finally  i reiterate my thumbsdown rating for tmobile as a carrier  tmobile2their network coverage is very sporadic  and the network always seems overloaded  resulting in very unpleasant calling experience  if you can get this phone for cingular or att  go with the other carriers   the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone  and what a great phone it is  when i first saw the 6610  i thought it was too small  size after using it  i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket  earpiece it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder  but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree earpiece which is included  the earpiece has a button that answers and hangsup the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all  unless dialing a number  voice dialing2unfortunately  the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone  but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming  screen when i turned the phone on  the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is  resolution  color the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable  the phone has several color schemes you can choose from  i like the default blue  you can also set a background wallpaper  ringtone the ringtones included are awesome  and did i mention they were polyphonic  no more annoying series of beeps  this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music  ring you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call  the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries  with multiple phone number per entry  so you can program your boss s home  work and cellphone numbers all under one contact  phone the phone also sports an image gallery  with option camera attachment   a calendar  organizer  alarm clock with snooze  fm radio  way cool  even if it is just through an earpeice   games  java applications and gprs highspeed internet connection  gprs1tzone the gprs connection is sometimes slow  and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain  but the other tzones applications are quite useful  you can get weather  movies  horoscopes and more with a few clicks  the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code  but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go  tzone2one downside  as of this writing  tmobile has nt updated their tzone system to fully support the 6610  their website does not show it as a compatible phone  and should i try to access the game downloads on tzones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported  i have been assured this will be fixed soon  now  for the tmobile service  i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones  if you have a question  they have the answer  and should they not know it  they can find it out pretty quick  every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone  tmobile service uall my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved  i d like to see my old carrier do that  rate plan the rate plans are also very good  at least for me  different people have different needs  of course  but the tmobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive  the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from tzones worked  phone this phone is highly recommended otherwise   nokia makes a great phone  that s clear  menu  feature with all its complicated features  the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great  menu2the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for tmobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have  one of the things tmobile brags about is the fact that it s a  worldphone  and can be used in europe  etc yet they ve gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone  including italian  german  and dutch  internet2the internet functions of the phone  wap and gprs  will only work through tmobile s services  because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network  therefore  if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card  even if you unlock the phone  there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet  after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another  i got fed up and have decided to return the phone  bottom line  if you re attracted to this phone because of its triband feature so you can take it abroad  forget it  find another phone  or buy this one in its manufacturerunlocked form   ","negative":""}
{"id":40,"title":"a good phone  phone","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   radio signal speakerphone application it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps  what it lacks for me is nt available on one phone yet  namely gsm850  also sometimes known as gsm800   bluetooth and edge  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again  but for now this will do  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the triband gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  phone great phone   feature great features    speakerphone plan i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email  i went to an at 38 t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads  they told me i would have to connect to my laptop  which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email  with the tmobile unlimited tzones for  10  i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet  phone i have had no problems with the phone  friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it  i ve even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive  phone great phone  i d buy another    look excellent phone  the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures  bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better  default ringtone3one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone overall an excellent phone  tmobile the service from tmobile is very good too  in all a winning combination  worth every penny  phone use network great phone  easy to use  excellent network  no regrets     i purchased this phone for just 50  and there is no end to what i can do with it  phone nokia and tmobile really teamed up well on this baby  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet  without a bulky phone like the treo or something  which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it  now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school  people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant  service ringtone service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from tmobile and aim is great  now i can always be in contact  phone this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range  or like me  do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones  a great deal in general  i would not give up this phone for the world  phone 1 month  no problems  great phone i m very pleased with my 6610 phone  feature yes  the features are numerous  speakerphone the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had  people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i m even using a speakerphone  sound quality the sound quality is excellent  except  maybe a  tad  too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line  earpiece the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use  phone i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before  nokia has definitely won me over with this one   u look1first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better  radio the radio feature has superb sound quality  i ve compared this phone to others such as 6100  siemens sl55  even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them  design it has a classic design yet looks hip  is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel  weight uit is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket  for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style  battery the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there  one thing that i found out recently is that you do nt need tzones from tmobile to go online  every tmobile plan comes with gsm data  meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps  with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference   anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net  being able to download pics and ringtones  not java apps  you need tzones for that   tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans  if you thought about getting this phone buy it  phone this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities   it does well in all aspects of internet browsing  as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it   battery life is good for a phone of this size  voice dialing but anyway  the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing  screen sound great screen and great sound  ok  everybody loves the fm radio in this  but you want a cell phone first  right  phone the 6610 excels as a cell phone  thank god  voice quality reception the voice quality is very good  and it gets great reception  that is  in places where you get tmobile coverage  which is not that good  see below   screen command the color screen makes this freeafterrebates phone shine bright  and commands are very responsive  button2my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons  nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad  which imho is totally unnecessary  key2this model does have the traditional key arrangement  it s just that they are really close to one another  and have unconventional shapes  so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands   to be fair  the same can be said about many korean imports  and the nokia s build quality is light years ahead of the koreans   phone other than that  this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips  tmobile2finally  i reiterate my thumbsdown rating for tmobile as a carrier  tmobile2their network coverage is very sporadic  and the network always seems overloaded  resulting in very unpleasant calling experience  if you can get this phone for cingular or att  go with the other carriers   the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone  and what a great phone it is  when i first saw the 6610  i thought it was too small  size after using it  i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket  earpiece it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder  but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree earpiece which is included  the earpiece has a button that answers and hangsup the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all  unless dialing a number  voice dialing2unfortunately  the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone  but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming  screen when i turned the phone on  the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is  resolution  color the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable  the phone has several color schemes you can choose from  i like the default blue  you can also set a background wallpaper  ringtone the ringtones included are awesome  and did i mention they were polyphonic  no more annoying series of beeps  this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music  ring you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call  the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries  with multiple phone number per entry  so you can program your boss s home  work and cellphone numbers all under one contact  phone the phone also sports an image gallery  with option camera attachment   a calendar  organizer  alarm clock with snooze  fm radio  way cool  even if it is just through an earpeice   games  java applications and gprs highspeed internet connection  gprs1tzone the gprs connection is sometimes slow  and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain  but the other tzones applications are quite useful  you can get weather  movies  horoscopes and more with a few clicks  the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code  but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go  tzone2one downside  as of this writing  tmobile has nt updated their tzone system to fully support the 6610  their website does not show it as a compatible phone  and should i try to access the game downloads on tzones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported  i have been assured this will be fixed soon  now  for the tmobile service  i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones  if you have a question  they have the answer  and should they not know it  they can find it out pretty quick  every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone  tmobile service uall my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved  i d like to see my old carrier do that  rate plan the rate plans are also very good  at least for me  different people have different needs  of course  but the tmobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive  the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from tzones worked  phone this phone is highly recommended otherwise   nokia makes a great phone  that s clear  menu  feature with all its complicated features  the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great  menu2the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for tmobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have  one of the things tmobile brags about is the fact that it s a  worldphone  and can be used in europe  etc yet they ve gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone  including italian  german  and dutch  internet2the internet functions of the phone  wap and gprs  will only work through tmobile s services  because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network  therefore  if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card  even if you unlock the phone  there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet  after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another  i got fed up and have decided to return the phone  bottom line  if you re attracted to this phone because of its triband feature so you can take it abroad  forget it  find another phone  or buy this one in its manufacturerunlocked form    feature this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it  i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then   i did nt had any problem till now  design screen the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution  weight signal it is very light weight and has a good signal strength  sound quality2however  the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality  it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier  voice2when talking the voice is not very clear  phone but  i would definately recommend this phone  go for it   ","negative":""}
{"id":41,"title":"people with bad audio quality have defective phones  i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about  sound quality","positive":" work there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city  exchange you wanted  att customer service2after several years of torture in the hands of att customer service i am delighted to drop them  and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 familyphones from att to tmobile  signal quality i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area  suburbs  and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky  cincinnati  i experienced perfect signal and reception along i75  far superior to at 38 t s which does not work along several long stretches on that same route  i have owned motorola  panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia  this phone combines many of the best nokia features  the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition  speaker phone radio infrared my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared  speaker phone the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car  very audible even with freeway noise  infrared the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers  the combination of the nokia 6610 and tmobile service  signal  price  service  is a winner  i highly recommend it   u sturdy here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy  game pim radio it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio  reception2i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable  also  you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume  ear2the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone background screensaver memory2the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there   color2the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be  however  it serves its purpose  backlight1the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this  i checked with nokia  button1the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options1the menu options are uncreative  as you can t see a full screen of menu items to pick from  you have to scroll up and down to find what you re looking for  yes  this is minor  but not when you re trying to keep your eye on the road    more downside to this phone  volume2the volume  oh my goodness  volume2i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet  forget talking on it in public  you just can t hear the other person  battery life on the upside  the phone has amazing battery life  phone i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it  i was surprised by tmobile s service  tmobile reception3i assumed they had exceptional service  but their reception in my area  los angeles  is horrendous  reason  they piggyback on cingular s service  tzone3also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works  customer service2since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised tzones would work  in 24 hours   tzone2i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked  24 hours  by what time standards  martian  tmobile2apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands  also  they d forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service  duh   so that took another 45 days of figuring out  customer rep in all fairness  customer reps are very nice  and they  most of them  try hard to answer your questions  but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they ve answered all your questions  even if they did nt  to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you  i realize this is for quality assurance purposes  but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered  ie me   when will my tzones work    csr   i m not sure     umm  well  thanks for nothing  this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he d answered all my questions  same interaction as i just described   and well   that was annoying  csr tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s  call2however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line  and no tzones  so what s the point  sprint i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional  i ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500vm4500  which i love  and i m okay with my services  guess all that glitters is not gold  it was worth a shot  too bad it did nt work out  hope someone else has better luck   while i like the performance of the phone in every regard  i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it  nokia i highly recommend a nokia 6610   no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers  speakerphone from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone  radio whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio  wish it were a flip phone  but thats not a deal breaker   i treat the battery well and it has lasted  at my heaviest usage  i must recharge after 3 days  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls  signal strength will affect the battery life  frequent signal searches eat up battery power  i took great care of the screen  till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at  volume2the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring1some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to  tone2the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration1the vibration is not top  it is a teeny phone  so it is hard to put a big mechanism in  i do nt use the vibration  because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this  so it was no loss  phone overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned  battery life size volume1ugreat battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options  look1ui am bored with the silver look   it has a nice color screen  size uit is small  radio  radio1radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in  that is a major minus  but its not that bad  tmobile tmobile was a pretty good server  it has 2 games  game2pthey are not wowable good  you have to buy better ones  voice dialing2it also does nt have voice activated dialing  big minus    warranty2this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone2we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use  i ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back    fm  earpiece while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece  size2u operate2u button2negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button  key2poor visibility on the keys  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them    reception the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make  camera1only con i can think of is no camera   no big deal for the size   phone this phone is a winner   anything this phone does  it does perfectly  speakerphone radio the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly  the speakerphone  speakerphone this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone  speakerphone pas said before this works perfectly  volume you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance  speakerphone uthe person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly  speakerphone uyou can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly  speakerphone1only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing  the radio  radio this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in  radio this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly  triband  featureone highly beneficial feature of this phone  at least to me  is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm  a few in asia  phone i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly  tmobile1the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile  reception anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception  if it worked like that in south africa  i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe  sold in other parts of the world  phone another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world  phone this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any tmobile store  which are located in many countries in europe  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service  able to use service in another country  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time  you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country  size and weight  size weight when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light  size this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket  battery life  battery life the battery life on this phone is surreal  it lasts  truly  7 days on standby  battery i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar  battery it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light  phone this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial  bluetooth1high speed internet1the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone overall  i highly recommend this phone  phone it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package   size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you  ringing tone radio sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored  speakerphone speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch  web surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available  cons  ring tone2ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings  there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen2the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game2games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games   size nice little phone  light compact   great features   button2buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem   although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department  it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do  to be a wireless telephone  reception sound quality the reception and sound quality are topnotch  i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs  which is an unaccustomed luxury  even with tmobile service  size weight i like the size and weight of this little critter  size ui am able to carry it close to my body  in places where other phones are not so easily concealed  layout1the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird  key1the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead  but that s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors  picture it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones  user interface1there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option1the menu options appear one at a time  taking up the whole screen  and one has to scroll down one by one  or have memorized where they are in the menu order  to select them by using the number keypad  thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting2the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting2pso loud  really  that it does nt work terribly well as a silent ringer option  ringer but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street   which was a good thing  because i realized i had forgotten my phone  voice dialing1headset jack1other things that i miss are voiceactivated dialing and a standard 25 mm headset jack  i d like a camera phone  but i d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls  pros  weight  design  light  compact design construction  solid  highquality construction keypad  wellbacklit keypad reception  outstanding signal reception sound quality  excellent sound quality screen  bright  visible screen speakerphone  speakerphone battery life  very longlasting battery life cons  user interface1 some features in the user interface voice dialing1 no voice activated dialing  what were they thinking picture1 ringtone1 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack1 no propietary headset jack  one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate  speakerphone i like the speakphone function a lot  it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs  quality durability i am very pleased with its quality and durability  key lock i like the automatic key lock function  weight the phone is very light weight  screen  ring tone the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited  fm radio the fm radio is cool  most of our emplyees use this model phone  best regards sadoun satellite sales  while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones  after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends  i bought this nokia 6610  phone and really this is the best phone one could have  feature it has all the features one would need in a cellphone  weight phone it is lightweight  sleek and attractive  phone  menu this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc  the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only  radio it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime  speakerphone its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside  wallpaper tune it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes  camera1only if we could get one camera in it   it did have scored over all other competitors  phone i am enjoying my phone a lot   small size  size ui love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it  just make sure the keys are locked  color screen color screen is good  calendar it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar  key the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing  menu navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone  battery life battery life is very good  i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so  cons  not many  volume key2the volume key can be hard to press  but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw  perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable2pc cable is too expensive   50 for a usb cable  please  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software   nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception  i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone  the motorolla t720 series  and the sony ericsson t610 series  loud phone the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do nt need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk  overall design  size ui like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets  of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest  the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small  as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a  you wont scratch your screens  keys b  you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys  ease of use  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu  the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons  like assign alarm clock to the left directional key   that is a very nice feature  the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones  t610  t720i   the sony ericsson phone  t610  has the most whistles and bells  but is also the hardest to use  battery  the nokia  samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do nt talk too much  the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day  although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life   features  the t610 has the most functionality hands down  personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice  my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity  the t610 can also compose music  a feature which most wo nt use  radio2the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless  application2it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc   the s105  samsung  has a beautiful big display  65000 colors   and i can t say much about the motorolla  all these phones have color screens  polymorphic tones  and are internet ready  in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords  thats number of different instruments which it can play  i think  the samsung i think have 15  i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones  software1regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop  i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft  oh well  phone overall this is a slightly better than average phone  both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more  i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year  if tmobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610  they are all free if you get a new account anyway  but stick to tmobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because tmobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling   this is the best phone i have seen   the phones are awesome  battery life ureception  application we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome  here s a hint  go to nokiacom and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth  pc suite you can do  so  much more with the pc suite  ie free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps  games  sound quality the phone s sound quality is great  turn up the volume if its too quiet  people  this thing will get loud  i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing   i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it  size ugame ringtone nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom  i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had  radio the features are really cool like the radio  radio the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it  speaker technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone    why i do nt can this product without a plan  i m live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators  i m pay in autodebit in my account  please  if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions  i m wait very happy  thanks   gsm1i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone  as i travel quite a lot  i d want something with gsm as well as cdma triband  phone for a specific location  i still think its a great phone   screen ergonomics size uthis really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny  i waited a few years between phones  mostly because  like most i think  i didnt really need one  size this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out  the downside though  may be a big one for you  volume2uits quiet  really quiet  grandma in church quiet  i ve gotten used to it  holding it in just the right realation to the ear  ducking into quieter places in bars  but when others borrow it they re shocked i can use it  so  i recomend it  but not for those that have any hearing troubles  or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places  which is annoying  by the way    nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them  volume ufirst of all  my calls were loud and clear  unlike with sprint  reception ui could make phone calls from locations i previously could not  like my apartment   size uweight design the phone is small  light  and very attractive  battery life the battery life is amazing  color screen ringtone the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones  phone i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs  phone pi highly recommend this phone to anyone  i ve yet to be dissappointed    feature it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features  truly  i am quite impressed     weight ubattery life this is a very light phone  a little less than 3 oz  with long battery life  not as long as the new polymer technology   on an average  you would charge it once a week  speakerphone the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own   speakerphone pi simply love this feature  headset in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset  radio the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport  if you buy the stereo headset  you will enjoy it much more  pc sync the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software  with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth   no more hazzles of keying in all data  using the small phone keypad  just maintain them  phonebook  calendar and todo list  in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth  tone wallpaper application additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc  message picture sharing the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy  mms the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy  the builtin camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff  if you have a good digital camera  there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone  however  if you are keen  you can attach a camera to this phone  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet  which i will be doing soon  i felt that i should write this comment asap  as i am quite excited in using its features  phone i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime   feature not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want  if you can live without an integrated camera  you wo nt miss much more  use in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned  phone book speakerphone the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent  radio even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are  voice dialing2although i find it more convenient to use 1touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing  key2the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press  battery life however  the battery life is good enough you should nt be overly concerned with turning this phone off  volume control3in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the sidemounted volume control  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack1one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work  phone overall this is the best phone i have ever owned  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages  phone unokia does not disappoint in this model  go for it   radio signal speakerphone application it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps  what it lacks for me is nt available on one phone yet  namely gsm850  also sometimes known as gsm800   bluetooth and edge  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again  but for now this will do  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone  but its not shipping at time of writing and the triband gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam  phone great phone   feature great features    speakerphone plan i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email  i went to an at 38 t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads  they told me i would have to connect to my laptop  which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email  with the tmobile unlimited tzones for  10  i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet  phone i have had no problems with the phone  friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it  i ve even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive  phone great phone  i d buy another    look excellent phone  the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures  bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better  default ringtone3one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone overall an excellent phone  tmobile the service from tmobile is very good too  in all a winning combination  worth every penny  phone use network great phone  easy to use  excellent network  no regrets     i purchased this phone for just 50  and there is no end to what i can do with it  phone nokia and tmobile really teamed up well on this baby  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet  without a bulky phone like the treo or something  which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it  now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school  people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant  service ringtone service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from tmobile and aim is great  now i can always be in contact  phone this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range  or like me  do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones  a great deal in general  i would not give up this phone for the world  phone 1 month  no problems  great phone i m very pleased with my 6610 phone  feature yes  the features are numerous  speakerphone the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had  people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i m even using a speakerphone  sound quality the sound quality is excellent  except  maybe a  tad  too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line  earpiece the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use  phone i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before  nokia has definitely won me over with this one   u look1first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better  radio the radio feature has superb sound quality  i ve compared this phone to others such as 6100  siemens sl55  even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them  design it has a classic design yet looks hip  is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel  weight uit is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket  for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style  battery the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there  one thing that i found out recently is that you do nt need tzones from tmobile to go online  every tmobile plan comes with gsm data  meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps  with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference   anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net  being able to download pics and ringtones  not java apps  you need tzones for that   tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans  if you thought about getting this phone buy it  phone this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities   it does well in all aspects of internet browsing  as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it   battery life is good for a phone of this size  voice dialing but anyway  the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing  screen sound great screen and great sound  ok  everybody loves the fm radio in this  but you want a cell phone first  right  phone the 6610 excels as a cell phone  thank god  voice quality reception the voice quality is very good  and it gets great reception  that is  in places where you get tmobile coverage  which is not that good  see below   screen command the color screen makes this freeafterrebates phone shine bright  and commands are very responsive  button2my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons  nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad  which imho is totally unnecessary  key2this model does have the traditional key arrangement  it s just that they are really close to one another  and have unconventional shapes  so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands   to be fair  the same can be said about many korean imports  and the nokia s build quality is light years ahead of the koreans   phone other than that  this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips  tmobile2finally  i reiterate my thumbsdown rating for tmobile as a carrier  tmobile2their network coverage is very sporadic  and the network always seems overloaded  resulting in very unpleasant calling experience  if you can get this phone for cingular or att  go with the other carriers   the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone  and what a great phone it is  when i first saw the 6610  i thought it was too small  size after using it  i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket  earpiece it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder  but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree earpiece which is included  the earpiece has a button that answers and hangsup the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all  unless dialing a number  voice dialing2unfortunately  the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone  but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming  screen when i turned the phone on  the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is  resolution  color the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable  the phone has several color schemes you can choose from  i like the default blue  you can also set a background wallpaper  ringtone the ringtones included are awesome  and did i mention they were polyphonic  no more annoying series of beeps  this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music  ring you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call  the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries  with multiple phone number per entry  so you can program your boss s home  work and cellphone numbers all under one contact  phone the phone also sports an image gallery  with option camera attachment   a calendar  organizer  alarm clock with snooze  fm radio  way cool  even if it is just through an earpeice   games  java applications and gprs highspeed internet connection  gprs1tzone the gprs connection is sometimes slow  and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain  but the other tzones applications are quite useful  you can get weather  movies  horoscopes and more with a few clicks  the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code  but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go  tzone2one downside  as of this writing  tmobile has nt updated their tzone system to fully support the 6610  their website does not show it as a compatible phone  and should i try to access the game downloads on tzones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported  i have been assured this will be fixed soon  now  for the tmobile service  i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones  if you have a question  they have the answer  and should they not know it  they can find it out pretty quick  every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone  tmobile service uall my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved  i d like to see my old carrier do that  rate plan the rate plans are also very good  at least for me  different people have different needs  of course  but the tmobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive  the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from tzones worked  phone this phone is highly recommended otherwise   nokia makes a great phone  that s clear  menu  feature with all its complicated features  the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great  menu2the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for tmobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have  one of the things tmobile brags about is the fact that it s a  worldphone  and can be used in europe  etc yet they ve gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone  including italian  german  and dutch  internet2the internet functions of the phone  wap and gprs  will only work through tmobile s services  because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network  therefore  if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card  even if you unlock the phone  there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet  after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another  i got fed up and have decided to return the phone  bottom line  if you re attracted to this phone because of its triband feature so you can take it abroad  forget it  find another phone  or buy this one in its manufacturerunlocked form    feature this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it  i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then   i did nt had any problem till now  design screen the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution  weight signal it is very light weight and has a good signal strength  sound quality2however  the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality  it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier  voice2when talking the voice is not very clear  phone but  i would definately recommend this phone  go for it   uit is crystal clear  phone this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made  i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks  there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free   ","negative":""}
