to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds

and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it

however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy

stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   ","negative":""}
{"id":38,"title":" poor quality dvd player  player3i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts  and both were bad  player3the first one would nt work from the start  player2the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out  amazoncom promptly refunded my money for the first one  because a replacement was not available  thanks amazoncom  i am still trying to resolve the problem

black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv

has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   ","negative":""}
{"id":40,"title":" no picture and  or no sound  try ip button on the remote  product3uwe have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working  it is connected to an old television

the trouble shooting section in the user s manual  suggesting correct and secure connections  does nt help  i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem  press ip button on the remote control  it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode  obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode  product","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best

digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   ","negative":""}

onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   ","negative":""}

people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   ","negative":""}

find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small

quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   ","negative":""}

player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   ","negative":""}

the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   ","negative":""}
{"id":55,"title":" does not play dvds with extra features   dvd2first of all  i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed  player","positive":"im a more

dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive

can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   ","negative":""}

for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   ","negative":""}

buy one  ","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe

with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   ","negative":""}
{"id":60,"title":" quirky  i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house  size","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular

to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas

{"id":62,"title":" great player  when it worked  video output3video output stopped workin  video output3this was an awesome player  before the video output no longer worked  after about 3 weeks   i might have gotten a lemon  but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine  i am returning it  and again in the market for a multiformat dvd  svcd  vcd  mp3  etc player  player3uwhat a disappointment  ","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom

i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   ","negative":""}

great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their

affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd

my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping

{"id":65,"title":" retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  display","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said

valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player

just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player

feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small

quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who

very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output

{"id":68,"title":" only lasted a month  i bought the 2600 because it plays everything  video output3well  within 45 days the video output quit working  both rca  optic   video output3puso now it still plays everything  you just can t see it  ","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s

strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus

zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so

also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading

for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine

ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great

good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   ","negative":""}

after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the

{"id":72,"title":" let the countdown begin apex  what can i say  i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever  quality design  stable  plus it uses a standard ide

work corectly from the start and the ad1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up  my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003  i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again  as i do like them  it really does nt make any cents   to build a great

onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i

player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   ","negative":""}
{"id":74,"title":" my first dvd player and i m well satisfied  i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player  i knew nothing about dvds before this but with this machine i figured it all out very quickly  feature","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because

owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon  ","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i

of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before

stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   ","negative":""}

had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart

a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   ","negative":""}
{"id":78,"title":" apex and remote control  hi  many people are saying   you get what you pay for  i guess   well that is not true  you could have paid more and got a lot less  i paid  49 and now it s

then it does not work  and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong  3  you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken  4  it did play my jpeg photos but wow  trying to figure it out was really something  universal remote control25  this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control  i dare you to surf the net and find the code  you will be told goldstar codes work  and you will be told zenith codes will work  and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work  code2finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600  and then you will start to belive them  if this is your fist dvd player  save yourself some aggrivation  ","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca

the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i

began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and

seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the

and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    ","negative":""}
{"id":81,"title":" fantastic dvd player for the price  i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that s a few years old  player","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what

having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read

season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the

you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs

though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   ","negative":""}
{"id":82,"title":" lots of sound but no picture  i bought this for my dad for christmas  picture3when i hooked it up it only produced sound  a cd played fine  but with a dvd i only got the audio  no picture  let s face it  when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture  as i travelled internationally and did nt want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin  had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally  panasonic  which worked just fine  save your cash  go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation  ","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the

customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg

tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   ","negative":""}
{"id":85,"title":" a very embarassing gift  i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it  both here and in other places  player3uafter less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge

valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player

success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   ","negative":""}
{"id":86,"title":" great  for the first three hours  player3i was impressed by this very inexpensive playerfor the first three hours  and then it died  i was told that it is no longer available  so there must be something really wrong with it  ","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and

{"id":87,"title":" you get what you pay for  player","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with

there either  guess where this unit is headed  yup  right back for a refund   ","negative":""}

bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  player pi just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  noise1 external display2there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like

month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  player pi just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  noise1 external display2there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my prev machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance  look feature still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features  so i popin my first dvd and start to watch  freeze2i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes  ok  that happens  so i try to skip the chapter  nothing  player3pi try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would nt do it  player3pi try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would nt work  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged  upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause  i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3year  old unit again just to see  the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question  i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either  guess where this unit is headed  yup  right back for a refund   this is probably one of the few dvd players at  40 that can play almost everything you throw at it  the plus points are  1  price 2  format ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all 3  look good looks the downside  1  quality3the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 2  remote button2remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons  if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed  i would rate this a 5 star machine   ","negative":""}
{"id":90,"title":" great cheap buy  player","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the

buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the

rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  player pi just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  noise1 external display2there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my prev machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance  look feature still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features  so i popin my first dvd and start to watch  freeze2i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes  ok  that happens  so i try to skip the chapter  nothing  player3pi try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would nt do it  player3pi try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would nt work  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged  upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause  i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3year  old unit again just to see  the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question  i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either  guess where this unit is headed  yup  right back for a refund   this is probably one of the few dvd players at  40 that can play almost everything you throw at it  the plus points are  1  price 2  format ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all 3  look good looks the downside  1  quality3the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 2  remote button2remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons  if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed  i would rate this a 5 star machine   this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player  player i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it  apex apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players  weight also  very light and portable   ","negative":""}
{"id":91,"title":" apex 2600  dvd disc3 read3the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc  read","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and

season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy

no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  player pi just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  noise1 external display2there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my prev machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance  look feature still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features  so i popin my first dvd and start to watch  freeze2i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes  ok  that happens  so i try to skip the chapter  nothing  player3pi try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would nt do it  player3pi try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would nt work  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged  upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause  i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3year  old unit again just to see  the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question  i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either  guess where this unit is headed  yup  right back for a refund   this is probably one of the few dvd players at  40 that can play almost everything you throw at it  the plus points are  1  price 2  format ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all 3  look good looks the downside  1  quality3the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 2  remote button2remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons  if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed  i would rate this a 5 star machine   this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player  player i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it  apex apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players  weight also  very light and portable    cd audio disc it will read and play all cd audio disc  guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one  so far not going to get a good review  a disipointed customer   ","negative":""}
{"id":92,"title":" hit and miss  amazon","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the

one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  player pi just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  noise1 external display2there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my prev machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance  look feature still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features  so i popin my first dvd and start to watch  freeze2i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes  ok  that happens  so i try to skip the chapter  nothing  player3pi try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would nt do it  player3pi try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would nt work  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged  upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause  i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3year  old unit again just to see  the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question  i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either  guess where this unit is headed  yup  right back for a refund   this is probably one of the few dvd players at  40 that can play almost everything you throw at it  the plus points are  1  price 2  format ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all 3  look good looks the downside  1  quality3the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 2  remote button2remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons  if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed  i would rate this a 5 star machine   this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player  player i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it  apex apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players  weight also  very light and portable    cd audio disc it will read and play all cd audio disc  guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one  so far not going to get a good review  a disipointed customer   i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far  i received the apex ad2600 before i expected  that is where my satisfaction ends  i bought the apex ad2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck  quality2however  it has failed to deliver on quality  jpeg2dvd2it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs  it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies  no disc2on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside  after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common  apex1i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand  but with my experience and reading the other reviews  i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product  i am returning mine for a replacement  but if i receive another ad2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund  but never buy another apex product in the future  i guess you get what you pay for   ","negative":""}
{"id":93,"title":" the ad2600 had false silver plate instead of play display  silver plate2the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display  the case had ad2600  bait and switch  picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured  yet false silver plate  what is up  clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined  i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this  ","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  player pi just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  noise1 external display2there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my prev machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance  look feature still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features  so i popin my first dvd and start to watch  freeze2i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes  ok  that happens  so i try to skip the chapter  nothing  player3pi try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would nt do it  player3pi try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would nt work  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged  upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause  i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3year  old unit again just to see  the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question  i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either  guess where this unit is headed  yup  right back for a refund   this is probably one of the few dvd players at  40 that can play almost everything you throw at it  the plus points are  1  price 2  format ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all 3  look good looks the downside  1  quality3the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 2  remote button2remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons  if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed  i would rate this a 5 star machine   this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player  player i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it  apex apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players  weight also  very light and portable    cd audio disc it will read and play all cd audio disc  guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one  so far not going to get a good review  a disipointed customer   i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far  i received the apex ad2600 before i expected  that is where my satisfaction ends  i bought the apex ad2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck  quality2however  it has failed to deliver on quality  jpeg2dvd2it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs  it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies  no disc2on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside  after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common  apex1i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand  but with my experience and reading the other reviews  i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product  i am returning mine for a replacement  but if i receive another ad2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund  but never buy another apex product in the future  i guess you get what you pay for   ","negative":""}
{"id":94,"title":" moderately impressed  i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers  no go on most formats  play","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  player pi just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  noise1 external display2there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my prev machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance  look feature still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features  so i popin my first dvd and start to watch  freeze2i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes  ok  that happens  so i try to skip the chapter  nothing  player3pi try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would nt do it  player3pi try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would nt work  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged  upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause  i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3year  old unit again just to see  the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question  i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either  guess where this unit is headed  yup  right back for a refund   this is probably one of the few dvd players at  40 that can play almost everything you throw at it  the plus points are  1  price 2  format ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all 3  look good looks the downside  1  quality3the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 2  remote button2remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons  if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed  i would rate this a 5 star machine   this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player  player i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it  apex apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players  weight also  very light and portable    cd audio disc it will read and play all cd audio disc  guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one  so far not going to get a good review  a disipointed customer   i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far  i received the apex ad2600 before i expected  that is where my satisfaction ends  i bought the apex ad2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck  quality2however  it has failed to deliver on quality  jpeg2dvd2it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs  it even has trouble properly playing dvd

that apex is a reliable brand  but with my experience and reading the other reviews  i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product  i am returning mine for a replacement  but if i receive another ad2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund  but never buy another apex product in the future  i guess you get what you pay for    cd  mp3  jpeg it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs  play2 windows media2 divx rip2however  it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips  i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd  svcd formats  but others say they can  player also  it was only  3999  after rebate  with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player  video quality good quality video   ","negative":""}

play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  player pi just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  noise1 external display2there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my prev machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance  look feature still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features  so i popin my first dvd and start to watch  freeze2i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes  ok  that happens  so i try to skip the chapter  nothing  player3pi try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would nt do it  player3pi try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would nt work  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged  upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause  i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3year  old unit again just to see  the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question  i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either  guess where this unit is headed  yup  right back for a refund   this is probably one of the few dvd players at  40 that can play almost everything you throw at it  the plus points are  1  price 2  format ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all 3  look good looks the downside  1  quality3the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 2  remote button2remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons  if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed  i would rate this a 5 star machine   this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player  player i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it  apex apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players  weight also  very light and portable    cd audio disc it will read and play all cd audio disc  guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one  so far not going to get a good review  a disipointed customer   i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far  i received the apex ad2600 before i expected  that is where my satisfaction ends  i bought the apex ad2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck  quality2however  it has failed to deliver on quality  jpeg2dvd2it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs  it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies  no disc2on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside  after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common  apex1i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand  but with my experience and reading the other reviews  i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product  i am returning mine for a replacement  but if i receive another ad2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund  but never buy another apex product in the future  i guess you get what you pay for    cd  mp3  jpeg it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs  play2 windows media2 divx rip2however  it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips  i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd  svcd formats  but others say they can  player also  it was only  3999  after rebate  with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player  video quality good quality video    dvdr it did play a dvdr which was unplayable in my older philips machine  i do nt have a dvd  r to try so  price mixed bag i guess but the price was right   ","negative":""}
{"id":96,"title":" great budget player  price","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case

player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  player pi just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  noise1 external display2there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my prev machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance  look feature still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features  so i popin my first dvd and start to watch  freeze2i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes  ok  that happens  so i try to skip the chapter  nothing  player3pi try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would nt do it  player3pi try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would nt work  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged  upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause  i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3year  old unit again just to see  the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question  i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either  guess where this unit is headed  yup  right back for a refund   this is probably one of the few dvd players at  40 that can play almost everything you throw at it  the plus points are  1  price 2  format ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all 3  look good looks the downside  1  quality3the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 2  remote button2remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons  if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed  i would rate this a 5 star machine   this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player  player i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it  apex apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players  weight also  very light and portable    cd audio disc it will read and play all cd audio disc  guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one  so far not going to get a good review  a disipointed customer   i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far  i received the apex ad2600 before i expected  that is where my satisfaction ends  i bought the apex ad2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck  quality2however  it has failed to deliver on quality  jpeg2dvd2it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs  it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies  no disc2on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside  after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common  apex1i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand  but with my experience and reading the other reviews  i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product  i am returning mine for a replacement  but if i receive another ad2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund  but never buy another apex product in the future  i guess you get what you pay for    cd  mp3  jpeg it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs  play2 windows media2 divx rip2however  it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips  i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd  svcd formats  but others say they can  player also  it was only  3999  after rebate  with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player  video quality good quality video    dvdr it did play a dvdr which was unplayable in my older philips machine  i do nt have a dvd  r to try so  price mixed bag i guess but the price was right   this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price  it goes nicely with my apex 27  in my bedroom  build quality picture sound the build quality feels solid  it does nt shake or whine while playing discs  and the picture and sound is top notch  both dts and dd51 sound good   i paid twenty dollars more than the current price  and even then it was a steal   ","negative":""}
{"id":97,"title":" fantastic bargain  hooray  think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player  well  not with this one  look","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  player pi just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  noise1 external display2there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my prev machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance  look feature still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features  so i popin my first dvd and start to watch  freeze2i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes  ok  that happens  so i try to skip the chapter  nothing  player3pi try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would nt do it  player3pi try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would nt work  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged  upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause  i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3year  old unit again just to see  the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question  i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either  guess where this unit is headed  yup  right back for a refund   this is probably one of the few dvd players at  40 that can play almost everything you throw at it  the plus points are  1  price 2  format ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all 3  look good looks the downside  1  quality3the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 2  remote button2remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons  if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed  i would rate this a 5 star machine   this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player  player i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it  apex apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players  weight also  very light and portable    cd audio disc it will read and play all cd audio disc  guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one  so far not going to get a good review  a disipointed customer   i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far  i received the apex ad2600 before i expected  that is where my satisfaction ends  i bought the apex ad2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck  quality2however  it has failed to deliver on quality  jpeg2dvd2it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs  it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies  no disc2on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside  after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common  apex1i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand  but with my experience and reading the other reviews  i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product  i am returning mine for a replacement  but if i receive another ad2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund  but never buy another apex product in the future  i guess you get what you pay for    cd  mp3  jpeg it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs  play2 windows media2 divx rip2however  it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips  i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd  svcd formats  but others say they can  player also  it was only  3999  after rebate  with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player  video quality good quality video    dvdr it did play a dvdr which was unplayable in my older philips machine  i do nt have a dvd  r to try so  price mixed bag i guess but the price was right   this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price  it goes nicely with my apex 27  in my bedroom  build quality picture sound the build quality feels solid  it does nt shake or whine while playing discs  and the picture and sound is top notch  both dts and dd51 sound good   i paid twenty dollars more than the current price  and even then it was a steal   u player pit looks really sleek and stylish  and does everything it claims  format i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did  product i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems  direction there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture  zoom etc  dvd player so sit back  relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can  and for a fraction of the price  only problem  if you think it s going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims  do nt hold your breath  otherwise it ll get there the day you get back from the hospital   ","negative":""}
{"id":98,"title":" value value value  sound","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  player pi just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  noise1 external display2there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my prev machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance  look feature still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features  so i popin my first dvd and start to watch  freeze2i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes  ok  that happens  so i try to skip the chapter  nothing  player3pi try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would nt do it  player3pi try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would nt work  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged  upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause  i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3year  old unit again just to see  the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question  i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either  guess where this unit is headed  yup  right back for a refund   this is probably one of the few dvd players at  40 that can play almost everything you throw at it  the plus points are  1  price 2  format ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all 3  look good looks the downside  1  quality3the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 2  remote button2remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons  if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed  i would rate this a 5 star machine   this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player  player i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it  apex apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players  weight also  very light and portable    cd audio disc it will read and play all cd audio disc  guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one  so far not going to get a good review  a disipointed customer   i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far  i received the apex ad2600 before i expected  that is where my satisfaction ends  i bought the apex ad2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck  quality2however  it has failed to deliver on quality  jpeg2dvd2it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs  it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies  no disc2on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside  after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common  apex1i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand  but with my experience and reading the other reviews  i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product  i am returning mine for a replacement  but if i receive another ad2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund  but never buy another apex product in the future  i guess you get what you pay for    cd  mp3  jpeg it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs  play2 windows media2 divx rip2however  it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips  i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd  svcd formats  but others say they can  player also  it was only  3999  after rebate  with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player  video quality good quality video    dvdr it did play a dvdr which was unplayable in my older philips machine  i do nt have a dvd  r to try so  price mixed bag i guess but the price was right   this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price  it goes nicely with my apex 27  in my bedroom  build quality picture sound the build quality feels solid  it does nt shake or whine while playing discs  and the picture and sound is top notch  both dts and dd51 sound good   i paid twenty dollars more than the current price  and even then it was a steal   u player pit looks really sleek and stylish  and does everything it claims  format i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did  product i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems  direction there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture  zoom etc  dvd player so sit back  relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can  and for a fraction of the price  only problem  if you think it s going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims  do nt hold your breath  otherwise it ll get there the day you get back from the hospital   weight noiseless  lightweight and oh yeah  work  player uworks great  color silverish color really adds a special touch  who cares if it does nt have multiple slots  format it plays just about any format  check before you buy if it plays yours   if you watch dvds once in a while like i do  get this  apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there  if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours  however  i do nt know the dvd s performance on a heavy load of everyday viewing  price either way  can t go wrong with this price   ","negative":""}
{"id":99,"title":" plays anything  dvd player","positive":"im a more happier person after discovering the ip button  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place  dvd player but  if you re looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it  dvd player pit practically plays almost everything you give it  player sound1i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor  price for the price it is a well spent investment  i would recommend buying one   pthis is by far the nicest one  in so many ways  look panel button layout feature it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set  forward  rewind its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had  video format it plays alternate video formats  vcds  svcds  cvds  very well  price and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong  i ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom  strengths are well listed by other reviewers  play  dvdr what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s   dvdr pit sure does  dvdr pthat s a rare and valuable feature  i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s  and it s a lot nicer to access them 45 gb at a time  dvdr  than 07 gb at a time  cdr   audio output another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i d scanned before buying  saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable  as i already had a coax cable  forward at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast  i wish it would do the same for movies  but that s one rare  cool feature you will have to forgo  remote control1 mp3 filename1weaknesses are minor  the feel and layout of the remote control are only soso  it does nt show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names  you must cycle through every zoom setting  2x  3x  4x  12x  etc  before getting back to normal size  sorry if i m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly   if you re a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rockbottom price  i highly recommend this model  finish update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it    look player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play  player3i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse  apex3will never purchase apex again  customer service3 technical support3customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive  tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them  pass this player up  and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas   for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised  dvd2 read2 play2then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all  cd2new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays  player3i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk  player3this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it  i intend to contact the company  but from what i ve read  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks  support3uapex does nt answer the phone   sigh   i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites  player i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him  now i need to buy myself another one  player phave used it frequently and have had no problems  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company  some models are better than others  player pi liked this one enough to buy another  apex my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money  picture quality feature great quality picture and features    feature it looks great  and is loaded with features  player2punfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type  player2uhave had problems since the first day play2 dvd2 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it  save money on the long run  buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month   the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me  player pi bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it  heat1uit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation  smell2it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time  freezing1the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air   this problem vanished after the first month  so i assume it was a temporary dust issue  the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend  player  he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them   jpeg slideshow mpeg1 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting  remote1the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons  button2i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed  while it is true that it will stand on end  it is also easy to knock over that way  zoom mode2i also did nt like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode  zoom2the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings  onscreen display2having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying  i have not used the progressive scan feature  this model has come down in price since i purchased mine  while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs  mine has run well  and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase  any possible problems should be weighed against the bangforthebuck factor  along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good aftersale support  player pwhile i would like to give it 35 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it   pnothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have  play2 dvd2unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode  dvd2on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t  player2unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything   we tried it out christmas night and it worked great  jpeg even viewed cds full of jpgs  we did nt get to use it again for over a month  sad  i know   picture2 player2pbut when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture  we saw reviews that said the same thing  and also saw here that their customer service stinks  though we were past the deadline for returns  by a few days   i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help  they authorized my late return  and hopefully they are giving apex heck  apex3i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone  do not buy this player  player3pwho knows how many uses you ll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will   well  it was nice while it lasted  player2after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds  player3uas an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale   uprogressive scan this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr  cdrw  dvdr  dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk i love the aiff  progressive scan feature  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos  but for  4999 go get one  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names   because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s  however  the ad2600 does nt have this feature  for now   play  different file the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s  play  mpeg it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video  mpeg pi find this to be a great feature  play pi ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great  feature for the money apex machines have good features  you can t find the mpeg playback on high priced units  design it s low profile  space saving design looks nice  player ui find the apex ad2600 to be a great buy   i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper  aff the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal  design loved the slim design   audio is excellent  well worth the money    format i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer  so far i ve played regular dvd s  backup dvdr s  mp3 cd s  and regular cd s  i have not yet tried the photo show capability  but i m thinking that will probably work well too  based on the success with the above mentioned disks  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit  the comments i ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remotefor instance  pushing the button to play pal  european type  movies  when an ntsc  usa type  movie disk is in the disk tray  so  if you read the instructions well  you should nt have any problems with this dvd unit  i can t speak to its longterm reliability  as i ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point  player pbut  it seems to work so well now  that i do nt anticipate any problems with it  bottom line for me is that for the price i do nt think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player   usimple to use and hook up  comes with standard rca jacks for output  along with svideo output  svideo cable not included  must be purchased seperately  and also component video outputs  progressive scan remote the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used  i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 12 years ago  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent  and does nt need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name  consider it for a future gift too   this is the best dvd player i ve purchased  i ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all  access speed  for those of you who has problems with this player  i d suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture  etc player this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong  80  of the features on here you will not get by spending  100 on a sony or panasonic  having said that  this is what you do   add to cart    check out    enjoy    well  this apex dvd player turned out great  media uit plays basically every media i ve tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could nt be played on my old  200 sharp player  user interface i have to say i m also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cdrs  dvds  it s almost like having a media player  file manager built into the dvd player  player i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player  what more can you ask for from a  40 dvd player  i guess i m just lucky to get a good working unit  hope the unit lasts as i ve only had it for 3 days  look upanel and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey  remote control2one bad thing though  i find the remotecontrol a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably  die  before the player does  shipping finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me   for the most part this is a good dvd player  dvd2 picture2 play2but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments  usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it  annoying   we are overall pleased with product  manual1i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual   price progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well   dvd sound seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise   read  svcd  vbr mp3 cd also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these   output output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv  bad  disc1 recognize2i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2   no disc2it would just spin up and stop  and display  no disc   remote3my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button  a ring around the enter  play button  button3you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll  svideo2also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv   pi checked out the amazon reviews and i m pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box  auto fit i like the auto fit feature  you can stretch widescreen dvd s to normal  lot s of other features that i need to find out about  look ulooks ok  very shiny chrome and mirrors  things that i d prefer different  there s a red light that shines when it s turned off  remote3and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck   pthis thing plays everything i feed it  compusa  memorex  fuji  plays them all  i ordered 2   uwhen i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd  r media disc s that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could nt get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with  use  size look easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot  very happy   it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive  2  look without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen  3  picture quality excellent picture quality  on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players  4  remote remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s  anyway  the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago  you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product  i d have given it 5 stars  but i m waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one  with progressive scan  i expect it to play play play  and give my old pioneer a rest   unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition  design player as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine  dvd2what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds  read2for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it  read2 dvd2at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well  player this player seems to work fine with everything else  so i do nt understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them  player2ubecause of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product    dvd it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented  i have a dvd burner  run  dvd media apex ad2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd  rrw and dvdr  rw  unlike sony or panasonic  one supports only  rrw and another supports  rrw   dvd player i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price  some of my friends had well branded dvdplayers but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks  apex most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy  if you are skeptical about trying apex  take my words and give it a try  hopefully you wo nt regret  goodluck   pthis has so many capabilities that you ll always have room for new technologies as they evolve  sound picture clarity i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched  case price uso much packed in a small case and very affordable   machine it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up  usage basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used  player pso far  we ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine  picture sound the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good  again  though  it has only been used sparingly  read2 disc2the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that  it s not a big deal for me  i simply watched the extra features on another player  had this been my only dvd player  though  it would have been a real problem  as it is  i m keeping the machine  player pit works well enough  so far  for me to be satisfied with it  and it s possible that i m missing something  but i would expect that  since my movie discs have all played with no problem  the extras discs would  too  without any additional tweaking  player i m giving this player cautious recommendation  player pthere are a lot of things i like about it  be advised  however  that you may encounter problems   received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector  remote1the remote is a little hard to understand  jpeg picture1my jpeg pictures are viewable  not so sharp and vivid  on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor  dvd so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read  prior to christmas  it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad  i would nt gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas   player2set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week  lipsync1there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue   video2but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working  amazon amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands   reliability2great feature list  poor reliability  output2output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold  thankfully amazon has free return shipping   retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display  player pit works great  i should have looked at it harder    format the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up    i guess only time will tell   remote1ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error   pit seems to be working fine  but we ve not used it all that much  i am returning the broken one today  i will not be ordering another one to replace it  player3update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product   feature the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling  dvd3i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds  after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time  the display indicated  no disk   video2after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available  disk2only one disk played through to completion successfully  at  49  i guess you get what you pay for  i d recommend against this unit   amazon is awaesome  they refunded my    so fast and paid for the shipping back  what more could you ask for   for the price  it s a very nice dvd player  door1the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile  format it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice  dvd and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony   i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there  size weight the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand  player ui ve had no problems at all so far and i m very happy  i applied a  25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying  29 for this machine  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal   besides the one problem  this machine is amazing  play uit plays everything  even vcd s  if only it played stand alone avi files  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating   pi will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of  player pbut for what i do use it is perfect  i was  however  somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander  small problem   owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide  customer service2uapex s website is down and they wo nt answer their phone   the dvd player is fine  to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing  if the dvd is stopped  it will display  playback only   little inconveinent  but unlike other players i only paid 40    pof course  i was hesitant given the price  but i ve been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents  picture the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv  loading2uit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that s inserted  maybe 10 seconds of wait  also  if you re an audiophile  you ll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short  player but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there   the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough  it also has an optical out  which it should  i think for about  40 more  you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though   remote layout there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote  player2all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift   i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category  player pi just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine  noise1 external display2there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my prev machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance  look feature still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features  so i popin my first dvd and start to watch  freeze2i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes  ok  that happens  so i try to skip the chapter  nothing  player3pi try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would nt do it  player3pi try navigating using the player s built in menu  and it still would nt work  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged  upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause  i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3year  old unit again just to see  the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question  i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either  guess where this unit is headed  yup  right back for a refund   this is probably one of the few dvd players at  40 that can play almost everything you throw at it  the plus points are  1  price 2  format ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all 3  look good looks the downside  1  quality3the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 2  remote button2remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons  if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed  i would rate this a 5 star machine   this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player  player i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it  apex apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players  weight also  very light and portable    cd audio disc it will read and play all cd audio disc  guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one  so far not going to get a good review  a disipointed customer   i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far  i received the apex ad2600 before i expected  that is where my satisfaction ends  i bought the apex ad2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck  quality2however  it has failed to deliver on quality  jpeg2dvd2it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs  it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies  no disc2on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside  after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common  apex1i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand  but with my experience and reading the other reviews  i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product  i am returning mine for a replacement  but if i receive another ad2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund  but never buy another apex product in the future  i guess you get what you pay for    cd  mp3  jpeg it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs  play2 windows media2 divx rip2however  it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips  i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd  svcd formats  but others say they can  player also  it was only  3999  after rebate  with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player  video quality good quality video    dvdr it did play a dvdr which was unplayable in my older philips machine  i do nt have a dvd  r to try so  price mixed bag i guess but the price was right   this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price  it goes nicely with my apex 27  in my bedroom  build quality picture sound the build quality feels solid  it does nt shake or whine while playing discs  and the picture and sound is top notch  both dts and dd51 sound good   i paid twenty dollars more than the current price  and even then it was a steal   u player pit looks really sleek and stylish  and does everything it claims  format i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did  product i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems  direction there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture  zoom etc  dvd player so sit back  relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can t do half the things this one can  and for a fraction of the price  only problem  if you think it s going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims  do nt hold your breath  otherwise it ll get there the day you get back from the hospital   weight noiseless  lightweight and oh yeah  work  player uworks great  color silverish color really adds a special touch  who cares if it does nt have multiple slots  format it plays just about any format  check before you buy if it plays yours   if you watch dvds once in a while like i do  get this  apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there  if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours  however  i do nt know the dvd s performance on a heavy load of everyday viewing  price either way  can t go wrong with this price   i am really impressed by this dvd player  if it can fit in the drive bay  this dvd player will play it  play  dvd for instance  i made several backups of my dvd movies using dvdr  w  and  r  w  and it plays the dvds  format no matter the format  awesome   ","negative":""}
